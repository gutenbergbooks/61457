<h3>
CHAPTER I.
</h3>

<h3>
THE TWO FRIENDS.
</h3>

<p>
October 4th.&mdash;I am going to keep a log.
I shall have to do it by-and-by when
I am Captain Charles Stewart, and so,
as I have been sent to school to prepare for
my work in the world by-and-by, this will
be helping in the preparation.  Mamma
often talks about my work in the world, but
I am almost sure there is no sea in the world
she is thinking about, while to me&mdash;well, the
sea is all the world to me.  But mamma
wants me to forget it, and all Uncle Alfred's
wonderful stories about it, and that is why
I have been sent here to school; but Tom
Haslitt is with me, and is not likely to let
me forget uncle and his sea yarns.  Tom is
to be my lieutenant by-and-by, and as he
will have to help with the ship's log then, he
is to take a turn with this.
</p>

<p>
It was kind of mamma to arrange for
Tom and I to have this little bedroom&mdash;cabin,
I mean&mdash;all to ourselves; but I am afraid she
would not be pleased to see how we have
rigged it up, considering that she wants me
to mount Uncle Charles's office stool by-and-by.
</p>

<p>
I hope that tarred yarn Tom has stowed
away under the bed don't smell too strong.
The compasses and charts and bits of boats
we've got hanging about are pretty
ornaments, and by-and-by, when we get our
ship finished, our little cock-loft will be
furnished.
</p>

<p>
I can't say much about the fellows here at
present, but they look a very quiet lot, and
one with fair hair certainly ought to have it
put in curl-papers every night.  I shan't have
much to say to him, I know; give him a
wide berth, and stick close to Tom.  If we
could only have gone somewhere else, some
school where they train sailors, I might learn
something, but it will do me no good to come
here, I'm sure, and I've told mamma so.
</p>

<p>
<a id="p8"></a>
October 6th.&mdash;The captain says I must
help with the log.  I'd rather heave up a
couple of hammocks here and bundle these
bedsteads out of the window, but I suppose
we may look out for squalls if we do too
much in the nautical line, for Charley has
got into a scrape already.  What they want
to keep housemaids for at a boys' school I
can't think, unless it is that they may go
poking about where they are not wanted.
I'm sure that rope yarn did not smell much,
but she found it out, that housemaid did;
and when Charley tried to get it back there
was a row.
</p>

<p>
The fellows here are not so bad, when you
come to know them, but I don't think I shall
ever like the governor&mdash;the Doctor, as
everybody calls him&mdash;or the under masters either;
although I think we shall be able to do very
much as we like here, as we have done at
home; at least, Charley and I mean to have
our own way in most things, if we possibly
can.
</p>

<p>
October 10th.&mdash;What a place this is for
rows!  Everybody looks as mild as turnips,
from the governor down to the housemaid
that took our yarn.  But looks are deceitful, I
suppose; at least, Tom and I won't have such
a pleasant, easy time as we expected.  If
things get much worse I shall write and ask
mamma to fetch me home; I'm sure she
wouldn't let me stop if I didn't like it,
for I have always had my own way about
everything but this sea scheme, and, like all
mothers, she's afraid of the sea, of course&mdash;thinks
it a monster that will certainly swallow
me up.
</p>

<p>
I don't know what to make of the
governor.  Yesterday he called me into his
room, and gave me a private lecture about
duty and conscience, and a lot more about
my lessons never being properly learned,
and about school being a little world where
character was tested, and made stronger and
nobler or worse, according as we used our
opportunities or yielded to our temptations.
I told Tom all about it afterwards, and we
laughed over it together; but I cannot forget
it, or the grave, earnest way in which the
governor spoke&mdash;exactly as though he knew
that Tom and I had made up our minds not
to learn more than we were obliged.
</p>

<p>
October 14th.&mdash;Tom hates keeping the log,
but I tell him he will have to do it by-and-by,
and so he ought to get his hand in now;
but he says we've come to school to have a
good time and as much fun as we can.  Well,
so we have, I suppose; at least, that was all
I thought about it until lately; but,
somehow, mamma's talk about preparing for our
life-work, and the governor's talk about it
being a test and trial of character, have
got mixed up in my mind, and it has made
me remember that mamma is not rich, and
that I am her only child, and I shall have to
work by-and-by.  I mean to work and take
care of her, buy a carriage for her to ride
in, and everything she wants when I am a
captain and have made my fortune.  But I am
afraid I shall have to begin by running away
to sea.  I've quite made up my mind to do
it, for mamma is more than a little
unreasonable about this, she won't even let me
talk about it to her.  But there, I won't
grumble; she's a dear mother, and reasonable
enough in everything else, and has always
let me have my own way about most things.
</p>

<p>
Tom has got himself into another scrape,
and the governor has threatened to separate
us&mdash;send Tom to another room and put
another fellow in here.  I should write home
to the mater at once if he did that, for it would
upset everything, and the place would be
unbearable.  Some of the fellows grumbled,
too, yesterday, that we were always in the
shed they call the workshop instead of in the
playground.  What is it to them if we like
to make boats instead of throwing a ball
about?  We can do as we like in the playground,
I suppose.  I hate cricket, that they
make such a fuss about here; and if they
drag me into playing it they'll soon find
I'm no good, and wish me out again.
</p>

<p>
October 20th.&mdash;This is the last chance I
shall get of writing in Charley's log, I expect,
for I am to be turned out of his cabin, and
Miss Chandos is to take my place.  I mean
to call him "Miss" in the playground now as
well as between ourselves, for I hate the
thought of his taking my place here.  I
wonder how Charley will like the young
lady.  Miss Chandos don't seem to like the
prospect much more than I do, but we dare
not rebel.
</p>

<p>
Charley is packing up my traps while
I do the log, grumbling all the time, and
threatening to serve out Miss Chandos.  The
young lady will not have it all her own way,
I can tell her.  There will be lively times
with her and Charley.  I wish I could stay
and see the fun, but I shall hear all about it
to-morrow, and Charley has promised to put
it all down in the log.  He says it will be
good fun to read this log over to ourselves
by-and-by.  We mean to keep it to read on
board our ship of an evening, and many a
good laugh we shall have over it, I dare say.
I wonder whether we shall ever laugh at this
turn out.  I don't think I ever shall, for
Charley and I have always been chums ever
since I can remember, so that it seems
like&mdash;like something dreadful to have him turned
over to Miss Chandos.
</p>

<p>
October 22nd.&mdash;No more of dear old Tom's
sprawling writing in our log, for I wouldn't
take it down into the schoolroom for the other
fellows to see; no, not for anything.  Yes,
poor Tom's gone, and Miss Chandos has
arrived.  I soon let her know what sort of
a welcome she was likely to have from me.
Tom's traps had hardly been bundled out
before the housemaid came with her hands
full, and white-faced Miss Chandos behind
her.
</p>

<p>
"Is this your lady's maid, Miss Chandos?"
I asked.  "Does she curl your hair and powder
your face?"
</p>

<p>
His face was scarlet enough then, but he
only said, "Thank you, Ann; if you will put
down those things I will put them into their
places."
</p>

<p>
"Oh, Ann," I said, with a sniff; "you had
better come back, Ann, and bring the
curl-papers.  Or do you use curling-irons?" I
asked.
</p>

<p>
Ann looked indignant, and Chandos too,
but neither said a word, and she went out of
the room.
</p>

<p>
When we were left to ourselves, and
Chandos had put away some of his things,
he suddenly turned round and said, "I hope
we shall be friends, Stewart."
</p>

<p>
I hardly knew what to say for a minute,
for I felt surprised and half ashamed of
myself; but, thinking of Tom, and what he
expected to hear, I made a mock bow, and
replied, "Gentlemen must always be friends
with a young lady.  Tom and I will be
delighted, Miss Chandos;" and then I stopped,
for such a look came into his fair girl-face as
never was seen in a girl's face before, I fancy.
There was no more said, and I went downstairs
feeling somehow as though I had not
got the best of it after all, and that I might
even be mistaken in thinking Miss Chandos
such a coward.  But after a little time spent
in the playground with Tom I forgot Miss
Chandos and her looks, until Tom reminded
me of it, and I promised to let him know
everything that happened.
</p>

<p>
Of course something was bound to happen
then.  How could I meet Tom in the morning
and tell him the young lady had slept in
peace, and everything had passed off
comfortably?  But what could I do?  Tom and I
generally had some fun throwing our clothes
at each other, or shooting paper pellets from
under the bedclothes after we had scrambled
into bed, until Swain came and took the light
away, and then we ducked our heads down
and went to sleep.  But there was no telling
whether Miss Chandos would tumble into
bed as quickly as we did.  I certainly was
not surprised to see her sit down and take up
a book that lay on the drawers and begin to
read.  I let her read in peace for about five
minutes, and then snatched it away and flung
it across the room.  I really did not see that
it was a Bible until it was out of my hand;
but I did not mean to let Chandos know that,
or that I felt sorry for throwing it.
</p>

<p>
"Don't do that again, Stewart," he said, as
he went to pick it up; and I burst out laughing
to hide my vexation, and asked when Ann
was coming to do his hair.
</p>

<p>
He took no notice of my question, and I
tumbled into bed, wondering what Chandos
would do next.  I had my pea-shooter and a
good supply of pellets ready for whatever
happened; but I certainly expected to see
him follow my example and tumble into bed.
But instead of doing this he kneeled down at
the side of the bed as though I had not been
there, which rather startled me, for I thought
he would and ought to be afraid to attempt it
after what I had already done.  I waited a
minute or two, and then, taking a good aim,
hit him right in the back of the neck.  It
made him start, I could see, and I laughed,
though I expected he would jump up and
give me a good pommelling the next minute,
for it was clear he was no coward, as I had
thought at first, and he would never have a
better chance of pitching in, if he meant to
fight it out.  But no, she kept on, and so did
I&mdash;pop, pop, pop at his head and the back of
his neck, until it tingled again, I know.  But
she wouldn't complain; wanted to make
believe she hadn't felt it, and said "Good
night," as though I was the most civil and
obliging companion in the world.  It was
plucky, anyhow, and I like pluck; but we
shall see who gives in first, Miss Chandos;
it will take a good deal to make me tire of
pea-shooting, I can tell you, and it will be
good practice too.
</p>

<p>
October 24th.&mdash;How Tom and I have
laughed over that plucky Miss Chandos!  I
am not sure that the fellow deserves to be
called "Miss" either, for he is plucky right
through, I know&mdash;the sort of fellow that
would walk up to a cannon's mouth without
flinching if he was a soldier and it was his
duty.  What a splendid sailor he would
make!  I could fancy him steering his ship
right under the enemy's guns if it was
necessary, but never yielding an inch or
knowing when he was beaten.  He's beaten
me at pea-shooting, and made me feel
ashamed of myself.  I wonder what Miss
Chandos is going to be&mdash;a parson, I should
think; and he means to do his life-work
thoroughly, and is beginning now, as I am in
keeping this log.
</p>

<p>
It seems queer that we shall all be men
very soon&mdash;some sailors, some soldiers, some
lawyers, and some tied to a merchant's desk,
which is mother's highest ambition for me.
She talks grandly sometimes about merchant
princes, and how uncle will give me a share
in his business; but I always try to get out
of the way, for I mean to run away to sea
when the time comes, and I hate to be a
hypocrite.
</p>

<p>
October 30th.&mdash;Another row.  I knew it
would come if they turned us out of our
workshop; but the best of the fun is, they
don't know who has been up to this mischief,
though Tom and I are both suspected, I
believe.  For a wonder, though, I had no hand
in this, I only wish I had.  Tom managed
cleverly, too, to turn all the farm-yard out as
he did&mdash;pigs and cows, ducks and hens; and
didn't they enjoy their hour's feast in the
garden!  I fancy I see the governor now as
he came rushing out in time to see the last of
his dahlias disappear, and then the whooping
and helter-skelter charge of the servants, with
the governor at the head of the fray.  This
will be something to laugh over many a night
when the wind is blowing great guns, and we
are pitching and tossing so that it is impossible
to read or write up the ship's log, which
we shall have to keep then.  The picture of
to-day's fun will rise up before us long after
everybody else has forgotten it.  Plucky
Tom!  I wish I had had a share of the fun
in setting the animals at liberty.  I don't dare
ask how he did it all yet, for the fuss is at its
height, and everybody is being questioned.
Of course, suspicions go for nothing, and
nobody really saw who did it, and so Tom is
not likely to be found out unless he splits
himself, which is not very probable, unless
somebody else is charged with it, and then
of course he would make a clean breast of it.
</p>

<h3>
CHAPTER II.
<br />
DISENCHANTMENT.
</h3>

<p>
November 1st.&mdash;Chandos has got
himself into a scrape, and nobody seems
to know what it is about.  I have
asked several of the fellows, but they only
shake their heads and tell me I know more
about it than they do.  I am sure I do not;
but as Chandos shares my room they think I
must be in his secrets, I suppose.  I cannot
help wondering what it is&mdash;something that
has got the governor's back up awfully, I can
see.  Chandos has been locked up all day in
the punishment-room, and nobody seems to
know whether he will be let out to-night.  I
wish I was sure he was not coming, and I
would try to get Tom in here, and we'd have
some fun for once.  I wonder what the young
lady has been up to.
</p>

<p>
November 14th.&mdash;I have not written up my
log for a fortnight, and now I have only a
miserable tale to tell.  At first I thought I'd
give up the log, as Tom will never be my
lieutenant now to laugh over it; but I'll keep
on with it a bit longer.  I thought we should
often laugh over Tom's setting the farm-yard
at liberty as he did, but somehow it seems to
have been a dreadful trouble to everybody;
but no one can feel just as I do about it, for it
has taken my old chum away from me, and
we can never be again what we have been.
What did they want to make such a fuss
about it for, and punish Miss Chandos?  The
governor must have been as blind as a mole
to think Chandos had anything to do with it.
It was ever so long before I found out the
tops and bottoms of the business; but at last
I found one of the juniors could tell something,
and I got him by himself and threatened
to break every bone in his skin if he didn't
shell out all he knew, and then it came out
that he had seen Chandos close to the farm-yard
just before the animals were turned out,
and the miserable little muff had gone with that
tale to the governor as soon as the row began.
</p>

<p>
"But you know it wasn't Chandos," I said,
thinking he must have seen Tom too.
</p>

<p>
"Wasn't it?" said the youngster.
</p>

<p>
I gave him a shake, and ran off to Chandos,
who was just going into the cricket-field.
"What's this row about you and the farm-yard,
Miss Chandos?" I said.
</p>

<p>
He seems to be getting used to his name,
and only said, "Oh, it's all right now, Stewart."
</p>

<p>
"Do you know who did turn the things
out?" I said.
</p>

<p>
"Do you?" he asked.
</p>

<p>
I nodded.  "It wasn't you, and I didn't
think you knew anything about it.
Suspicions go for nothing, you know."
</p>

<p>
"Well, let this pass.  It's over now, and
let's drop it."
</p>

<p>
"But you've been punished for what you
had no hand in.  Did the governor think you
did it?"
</p>

<p>
"I don't think he believed I actually did it
myself; but he said I was worse than those
who did it if I was screening them, for I was
encouraging insubordination in the school.
Do you know who was suspected, Stewart?"
</p>

<p>
"Me!"
</p>

<p>
"Yes; I cleared you at once, but I couldn't
say any more, and that vexed Dr. Mellor."
</p>

<p>
"Oh, the Doctor be hanged!  Why didn't
you go to Tom and tell him the fix you was
in?  I suppose you knew he did it?"
</p>

<p>
"I couldn't help knowing it where I was,
and I did contrive to say a word to him about
going to the Doctor, but&mdash;"
</p>

<p>
"You told Tom you were to be punished
for his fault, and he wouldn't make a clean
breast of it to the governor!" I said, angrily.
</p>

<p>
"There, I told you it was better to let it
pass, Stewart; you could do no good now,"
said Chandos, walking away.
</p>

<p>
But a sudden thought had seized me, and
I placed myself in his path.  "But you shall
give me a plain answer to my question," I
said; "not that I will believe it of Tom.  It
is you that are the sneak; you look one, with
your white face and quiet ways, and I know
you are only trying to set me against my old
chum!"  I was almost mad with rage, and
longed to knock Chandos down; and for a
minute he looked as though he would fight it
out, but the next he had pushed me aside,
and was striding on to take his place as
long-stop in the game that was just beginning.  I
looked after him for a minute, thinking I
would go and have it out, when I suddenly
thought of going to Tom, and turned back to
the workshop, where Tom was busy hacking
at some wood for a rudder.  "I say, old
fellow, did Chandos tell you he was taking
your punishment for the farm-yard scrape?"
I asked.
</p>

<p>
"Oh, never mind Chandos; come and rub
down this mast," said Tom, turning away.
</p>

<p>
"Then&mdash;he&mdash;did&mdash;tell&mdash;you!" I said,
slowly.
</p>

<p>
"Didn't you know Chandos was a sneak
before to-day?" said Tom, sharply.
</p>

<p>
"But&mdash;but tell me all about it, Tom," I
said, rubbing my eyes, and feeling as though
I must be dreaming.
</p>

<p>
"Oh, there ain't much to tell&mdash;nothing to
make such a fuss about.  The fellow came to
me, and said he had got into a scrape through
the things getting out; but of course I didn't
believe him.  This was an easy way of getting
me into a row, as well as helping himself out."
</p>

<p>
"But, Tom, if he took your punishment,
you know&mdash;"
</p>

<p>
"Bah! my punishment!  The governor
isn't such a duffer as to think that white-faced
milksop did that mischief.  He hasn't
pluck enough.  I always told you he was a
sneak, and now he's proved it, for he said the
thing should always be a secret between us,
whether I told or not, and now he's run
open-mouthed to you with the tale."
</p>

<p>
"No, he hasn't."  And without another
word I walked out of the workshop.  I didn't
feel as though I wanted to fight Tom; it
didn't seem as though I could fight, for I
couldn't understand things a bit.  Somehow
they'd got so mixed up in this row that Tom
seemed to be Chandos, and Chandos Tom,
and whether I should wake and find they were
all right, or Tom running about with Chandos's
head on his shoulders, I couldn't tell for a
little while.
</p>

<p>
But presently Chandos came walking
through the gate on which I was mounted,
and certainly he had his own straw-coloured
hair safe enough.  He didn't condescend to
look at me as he passed, and I felt as though
I hated him for robbing me of Tom.  What
right had he to do it&mdash;he with that white face
to be so plucky?  And not even for a friend
either, for Tom is no friend to him any more
than I am, and all the school have adopted our
private name, and call him Miss Chandos.  It
isn't as though he didn't care about it either, for
I can see he does.  No boy likes to be thought
a girl, or have a girl's name tacked to him;
and Chandos is like the rest, but he takes it
quietly, although I fancy now he would be as
good in a stand-up fight as Tom himself.
</p>

<p>
Bother Tom!  I don't want to think about
him now.  I wish he had left the pigs and
cows alone, or I hadn't been in such a fume
to find out all about it.  I don't like to think
he has been mean and cowardly&mdash;my brave,
bold Tom.  Anyhow, I shall always hate
Miss Chandos for her share in the matter, and
I'll call her Miss Chandos more than ever
now.  It's been a miserable time, somehow,
ever since I heard the tops and bottoms of
this row, for though Tom and I have never
said a word about it since, we both seem to
remember it always, and we keep apart as we
never did before.
</p>

<p>
November 20th.&mdash;All the school is in a
ferment about a special prize that is to be
given for the best essay on something or other.
I'm not going to try, so it don't trouble
me much; but it seems as though everybody
else is, and they can talk of nothing else.
Even Tom is going in for this, it seems, though
he don't stand much chance, I fancy; but he
wants a watch, and thinks he may as well try
for this.  The weather is dull and cold, and
our shipbuilding is almost at a standstill.
We haven't done much since that row, and
things are altogether miserable.  Tom seems
to be making new friends among the other
fellows, and I've dropped shooting at Miss
Chandos and hiding her Bible, so that
altogether I'm rather glum, and ready to quarrel
with anybody that is good for a stand-up
fight.  I know everybody thinks me a bear,
and I am, I think, for I don't care for anybody
or anything now.
</p>

<p>
November 30th.&mdash;It seems as though there
was never to be an end to this row, which has
made everything so miserable for me.  The
governor has taken it into his head to consider
the matter still unsettled, although Chandos
took Tom's punishment, and now poor Chandos
has been told that he can't try for this prize.
It's the meanest shame, for Chandos stood as
good a chance as anybody, if not better than
most, and now he isn't to be allowed that
chance.
</p>

<p>
He tries to hide his disappointment, but I
know he had begun to read up, and yesterday
I asked him if he didn't mean to split on
Tom, and tell the governor all about it.
</p>

<p>
"I wish Haslitt would do it himself," he
said; "it would be better for everybody if he
did."
</p>

<p>
"Of course it would; and I'll tell him so,
and the governor too, if you won't."
</p>

<p>
"No, no, don't do that, Stewart; the school
would send you to Coventry if you split on
another fellow about anything.  And besides&mdash;"
</p>

<p>
"Well, what more can the school do?" I
asked, angrily.
</p>

<p>
"Oh, nothing, only your splitting would do
no good now, I fancy."
</p>

<p>
"Well, Tom shall make a clean breast of it,
and give up his chance of this prize.  It ain't
much of a chance for him, and so it won't be
much for him to give it up; but you'll get it,
Chandos&mdash;at least I hope you will;" and
then I ran off to find Tom and have it out
with him.
</p>

<p>
I hardly knew how to begin, but I did it
somehow; and then Tom said, crossly,
"What a fuss you make about nothing!  I
suppose Miss Chandos has set you on.  Has
she taught you to say your prayers yet?"
</p>

<p>
"Saying my prayers has nothing to do
with this, Tom, you know that."
</p>

<p>
"Oh, hasn't it!  I thought the young lady
was making a milksop of you, you've been so
glum, lately."
</p>

<p>
"Now look here, Tom, I haven't told you
what I thought about this sneakish business,
but I will if you don't make a clean breast of
it to the governor at once."
</p>

<p>
"Well, who cares what you think?" said
Tom, laughing; and he tried to push past me.
</p>

<p>
But I wasn't going to have that.  "Now,
look here, old fellow, we have been chums for
ever so long, and I never knew you to do
anything mean before, and I believe you're
sorry for this; now make a clean breast of it,
Tom, and let Miss Chandos go in for this
prize."
</p>

<p>
"Has she told you she's sure to get it?"
</p>

<p>
"No, of course not; but you know she'd
stand a good chance&mdash;a better chance than
you do."
</p>

<p>
"I don't know so much about that, and I
don't see why I should give up my chance
just to suit your whims.  It wouldn't help
Miss Chandos either."
</p>

<p>
"Yes, it would.  The governor wants to
get at the bottom of this farmyard affair, and
that is why he is so hard on poor Chandos."
</p>

<p>
"Poor Chandos!  The young lady has
bewitched you, Charley!  As if this had
anything to do with that old row!  She knows
how to come it over you, the mean sneak!  As
though she didn't know this was for another
affair altogether."
</p>

<p>
"I don't believe it, Tom."
</p>

<p>
"Don't you?  Ask some of the other fellows,
then.  Here, Jackson, what did you tell me
Miss Chandos had been doing to lose her
chance of the prize?" called Tom.
</p>

<p>
"I don't know now.  Collins told me it
was some artful dodge the governor had
found out.  Anyhow, I'm glad she's out, for
the chances will be pretty evenly balanced
among us now; but Chandos always goes in
for such a lot of grind that he'd be sure to
swamp us all.  Do you go in for it, Stewart?"
he asked.
</p>

<p>
"I'm not fond of grind, and shouldn't
have a ghost of a chance, any more than
Tom has."
</p>

<p>
"Oh, well, Haslitt will pass muster, I dare
say, but we ain't much afraid of him," laughed
Jackson, as he ran away.
</p>

<p>
"I tell you the fellows will kick up no end
of a row now if they find I gave up for
Chandos to go in; not that I think he would
mind.  He's a sneak, and has just told you
this to hide something he has been doing
himself."
</p>

<p>
"Well, I shouldn't care for what the fellows
said, Tom.  They want to keep Chandos out&mdash;a
few of them, I don't believe they all do&mdash;just
because they will stand a better chance
of the prize; and it's mean and cowardly, and
I wouldn't help them in it if I were you."
</p>

<p>
"But I tell you, Charley, you mustn't go
against a lot like this.  I'm beginning to find
out that you must think of others a bit when
you are at school like this, and&mdash;and&mdash;"  There
Tom stopped.
</p>

<p>
"Look here, Tom; it may be all very well
to mind what other fellows say a bit, but I
never knew you to do a mean thing in my
life before, and I shall wish we had never
come here if it's going to make you a sneak
now."
</p>

<p>
"Who says I am a sneak?  Chandos, I
suppose?"
</p>

<p>
"No, it isn't Chandos.  He hasn't been
your chum as I have; he didn't know what
you were before you came to school, and never
talks about you&mdash;"
</p>

<p>
"Only to call me a sneak, I suppose?"
</p>

<p>
"No, he has never called you a sneak; but
I do, and mean it, if you won't go to the
governor and make a clean breast of everything."
</p>

<p>
"It would do no good, I tell you, Charley,
and the other fellows would be down upon
me directly if I did.  Three or four are going
in for this prize that wouldn't try if Chandos
wasn't out.  I tell you they'd never forgive
me if I split now.  I'll promise this, Charley,
I'll never get into a scrape like it again.  I
wish now I'd gone to the governor at once
about it."
</p>

<p>
"I wish you had; but it isn't too late, you
know, now, Tom.  Come on at once; we shall
find him in the library.  I'll go with you if
you like."
</p>

<p>
I really thought Tom would go then, but
just as we were turning round Jackson ran to
tell him Collins and the rest wanted him; and
Tom went off, calling to me,
</p>

<p>
"It's no good, Charley, I can't do it."
</p>

<p>
I felt half ashamed to meet Chandos after
this, for he knew I had been to talk to Tom,
and I couldn't bear him to think he was such
a sneak as he has been over this; but there
was no getting out of it, for he was standing
by the lobby door as I went in, and looked
at me in such a way that I said, crossly,
</p>

<p>
"Why don't you go to the governor yourself
and tell him all about it?"
</p>

<p>
"Then Haslitt won't go?"
</p>

<p>
"No, he won't," I said.  "This beastly
school has made him a sneak&mdash;he never was
before; he never served anybody such a
trick, and he never would if he hadn't come
here."
</p>

<p>
"Well, don't get so angry about it, Stewart.
My mother says one of the principal uses of
a school is to try what mettle we are of.
We cannot tell whether a character is strong
or weak until it has been tried, and the
temptations and failures at school prepare us
better for the temptations of the world
afterwards."
</p>

<p>
"What do I care about the temptations of
the world?  It's this school that has spoiled
Tom, and he will never be my chum again,
and I shall have to look out for another
lieutenant for my ship;" and I rushed off
indoors, for fear Chandos should say any more,
for I could not bear to hear him speak against
Tom.
</p>

<h3>
CHAPTER III.
<br />
THE SKATING PARTY.
</h3>

<p>
November 30th.&mdash;I haven't spoken to
Tom for a week, but he's so mixed
up with the other fellows now that he
don't seem to mind; but I am very dull, and
it makes me very miserable not to have Tom
working with me at our boats as we used to
do.  I have found out, too, that Chandos is
not a general favourite in the school, but he
has two or three friends&mdash;chums, like Tom
and I used to be&mdash;who seem to be fond of
reading, and don't get into so many scrapes
as Tom's set.  I belong to nobody just now.
I join in a game sometimes when I don't feel
too sulky; but I miss Tom too much to feel
pleased with anybody else, though Chandos
and I talk a bit sometimes when we go to
bed.  Last night we were talking about
prayer.  Fancy boys talking about that; but
it seems Chandos believes it is all as real&mdash;as
real as writing a letter to his mother, and as
sure of having an answer.  I was as much
surprised as when the Doctor talked about us
having a conscience; for it seems Chandos is
not going to be a parson after all, but is to go
into his uncle's counting-house, just as mother
wants me to do.  The only difference is that
Chandos has made up his mind to it because
it is his duty, he says, though he hates it as
much as I do, and wants to be a doctor
awfully.  I begin to think the world is a
dreadful puzzle.  Why can't people do just
what they like, instead of being driven to do
what they hate so often?  Chandos is a first-rate
sort of fellow too, I think, in spite of his
white face and curly hair; and yet he's got to
do what he don't like, so that being good
don't seem to have much to do with it, though
my old nurse used to say good boys were
always happy.  Well, I'm not good, anyhow,
so it's not very wonderful that I'm pretty
miserable; only Tom seems happy enough,
and he ought to be miserable too, which is
another of the puzzles, I suppose.
</p>

<p>
December 10th.&mdash;Everybody is essay mad&mdash;that
is, all the fellows in our class who
have gone in for it.  Chandos and I never
talk about it to each other, but I know he is
disappointed, for he was ill the first part of
this half, and so he will have no prizes to take
home at Christmas.  I suppose I should be
disappointed too if I was one of the fellows
that grind, but I don't see the use of it, and
so prizes don't come in my way.  Not but
what I should like to please mamma, and she
would be pleased, I know, if such a wonder
was to happen; but then I hate books, unless
they are about the sea, or something of that
sort.  I shall be glad when the holidays are
here now.  I should not like to confess it
even to Tom, but I want to see my mother,
and ask her some of the questions that have
puzzled me lately.  Then there is always lots
of fun at Christmas, and there has been so
little here.  Another week and this essay fuss
will be over, and then the fellows will talk
about the other prizes and going home, and I
shall try to forget all the bother, and Tom's
share in it too, if I can.  I wonder who will
get this essay prize&mdash;not Tom, I am certain.
</p>

<p>
December 18th.&mdash;Tom has got the prize.
I cannot understand it one bit.  I know he
has gone in for lots of grind lately, like the
other fellows, but there were two or three
that I felt sure would be better up to that
kind of work than he was.  I cannot feel glad
that he has won it, and I have not told him
I am; and some of the fellows that were
most urgent for him to go in have scarcely
spoken to him since.  I wonder whether they
think, as I do, that this watch should of right
belong to Chandos.  Tom and I are going
home together.  No one at home knows
anything of what has happened, and I shall not
tell them if I can help it.  Chandos has asked
me to go and see him in the holidays, and I
mean to ask mamma to let him come to our
house.  I think I shall like that better than
going to his place, for I fancy his people are
dreadfully religious, and we know nothing
about that sort of thing, but I don't like to be
thought quite a heathen.
</p>

<p>
January 20th.&mdash;The holidays are over, and
we are back at school in our old places once
more.  Tom has taken up the notion that I
am envious of his good luck in getting the
watch.  Good luck!  I call it bad luck, for it
was a bad business altogether, and I let out
something about this at home; but mamma
only thought it was one of our ordinary
quarrels.
</p>

<p>
I went to see Chandos in the holidays.  He
has several brothers and sisters; one of them
has come back with him to school, and is
among the juniors, although he is only a year
or two younger than his brother; but he has
been delicate, and is very backward, and so
was obliged to go into the lower division of
the school.  I like Mrs. Chandos very much.
She is religious after a different pattern from
my Aunt Phoebe, and somehow everything
seems so real about her that I don't wonder
Chandos believes everything she says.  But
I don't mean to like Chandos too much.  He
is all very well, but he is not Tom, and can
never be my lieutenant.  I had a talk to
mamma about going to sea, but she is as
obstinate as ever.  I told Chandos of this
when he came to see me, and he said, "Then
I am afraid you will have to give it up,
Stewart."
</p>

<p>
"Give it up! give up the sea! you don't
know what you are talking about, Chandos!"
</p>

<p>
"Yes, I do, for I wanted to be a doctor
quite as badly as you want to go to sea; but
when my father died, and my mother told
me how impossible it was that my wish
could be gratified, I set to work at once to
conquer it."
</p>

<p>
"Set to work to conquer it!  But how
could you do that?" I said.
</p>

<p>
"I&mdash;I began in the only way I could; I
asked God to help me for my mother's sake
to overcome the selfish desire, and make me
willing to do all I could to learn what was
necessary to be a merchant."
</p>

<p>
"But you don't hate the idea of being
chained to a desk as I do, or you wouldn't
talk so coolly about it."
</p>

<p>
"Not now.  But I did hate it quite as
much as you can, Stewart; but I remembered
that my mother was not rich.  When my
father died we were very much reduced, and
if I should offend my uncle by refusing this
offer he might refuse to help the younger
ones by-and-by; and so you see it was my
duty to forget myself and my own wishes,
and do what I could to help my mother."
</p>

<p>
"But my mother does not need my help,
and so I don't see why I should give up
everything I want, if you do."
</p>

<p>
"Your mother may not want your help, but
she wants you.  You are her only son, and&mdash;and
shall I tell you?&mdash;I have heard of such
things happening, you know&mdash;she may break
her heart if you run away to sea.  You would
not do that, Stewart."
</p>

<p>
"Break her heart!  Kill my mother!
Chandos, you know me better than that!"
</p>

<p>
"Yes, I do, Stewart, and that is why I have
spoken in time; but I have heard of boys
going to sea and coming home expecting to
find everything as they left it, and finding
mother and father both dead&mdash;killed by grief
for the runaway."
</p>

<p>
"Oh, that's all twaddle, you know, Chandos;
nobody ever really died of a broken heart," I
said.
</p>

<p>
"Then you mean to try the experiment on
your mother?  Very well, Stewart; if you
will, you will, I know; only beware of the
consequences, for if the twaddle should prove
truth it would cause you lifelong unhappiness
afterwards."
</p>

<p>
This ended his lecture, and I made up my
mind to forget it as soon as I could; but
somehow it mixes itself up with everything,
and try as I will I cannot forget it.  Of
course, I don't want to run away, if I can
persuade mamma to let me go to sea
properly; but if she won't, what am I to
do?  I can't and won't go to be perched up
at an office desk all day, and so there will be
nothing else I can do but cut and run some
fine morning.  Of course, I shall write to
mamma just before I sail, and tell her I'm all
right and jolly, and when she knows that
she'll soon be all right.  Tom and I have
talked over the plan dozens of times, for he
was to come with me, only somehow I don't
want him so much now, though his watch
might be handy to sell if we were short of
money on the road, for I suppose we should
have to go to Liverpool, or Plymouth, or
Southampton, or some of those places.
Bother Chandos, making me feel uncomfortable
about it.  But there, I'm not going to
run away to-day, and so I'll forget the whole
bother.
</p>

<p>
January 26th.&mdash;At last we are going to
have some fun.  It has been freezing
splendidly these two days, and if the governor
hadn't been a duffer he would have let us go
out on the ice to-day, for there is a first-rate
pond&mdash;two or three, in fact&mdash;close by, and I
know the ice will bear; but he has promised
we shall go to-morrow, and everybody has
been looking up skates in readiness.  I hope
it will not thaw to-night, for we are all
looking forward to the fun we shall have
to-morrow&mdash;all but Chandos, and he has
taken it into his head that his brother ought
to stay at home, as he has a cold.  But
Chandos junior has a will of his own, I can
see, and I mean to help him to stand out
against his brother's coddling, and give Miss
Chandos a fright into the bargain, if I can.
It will be good fun to coax the youngster to
go to another pond, especially if one happens
to be labelled "Dangerous."  I fancy I can
see his brother now running about like a hen
after her brood of ducklings, for he does fuss
after this youngster, as though he was different
from other boys, and I'll stop it if I can.
</p>

<p>
February 4th.&mdash;I wonder whether I can put
down in my log all that has happened.  I
shall try, for I am very dull to-day sitting up
here alone while the others are in school.
</p>

<p>
It did not thaw, as everybody feared it
would, and we started for the ponds in good
time, Swain and the other master with us, for
the governor would not trust us alone, which
made some of the fellows pretty wild, and
they vowed Swain should not come for
nothing.  Just before we started Tom came
tearing across the playground to me and said,
"You've split on Chandos junior!"
</p>

<p>
"Split on him!  What do you mean?  I
don't often speak to the youngster; you and
your set know more about him than I do," I said.
</p>

<p>
"Yes, but you and Miss Chandos are as
thick as thieves, and you know he did not
want young Frank to go to-day."
</p>

<p>
"Yes, I do know that, and I said if I was
Frank I wouldn't be coddled to that tune.
What of that?"
</p>

<p>
"Why, Chandos has locked him up or
something, for he isn't here."
</p>

<p>
"Locked up your grandmother!  How
could he do that without appealing to the
governor?  and you know Chandos is not
likely to do that now.  The youngster will
turn up presently, unless he has made up his
mind to do as his brother wishes, and declares
himself on the sick-list.  There are three to
stay indoors, you know."
</p>

<p>
"Yes, but young Chandos won't stay if he
can help it.  We've laughed him out of
that&mdash;told him the school calls his brother a
young lady for his meek ways, and the
sooner he breaks away from her apron-string
the better."
</p>

<p>
"Well, Chandos is too fussy," I said; "but
don't lead the youngster into any harm, Tom.
I'll help with some fun, just to give Chandos
a fright, you know."
</p>

<p>
"Bravo, Charley!  Jackson was just
talking about the same thing, and we'll do it
now."  And we both rushed off to Jackson
and the rest, to inquire if they had seen
anything of the youngster.
</p>

<p>
"It's what I call confoundedly selfish, if
Chandos has stopped the young prig from
coming out," said one of the fellows.
</p>

<p>
"Chandos ain't selfish," I said; for, though
I felt cross with Chandos myself, I did not
care to hear him run down by Tom's set.
</p>

<p>
"Well, I don't know what you would call
it, but if somebody tried to make me stay at
home the only day we are likely to have any
fun on the ice, I should feel ready to punch
him."
</p>

<p>
"I don't believe Chandos junior will stay.
But now, what are you going to do with him
when he comes?"
</p>

<p>
"Do with him!  Do you think we want to
eat him, Stewart?"
</p>

<p>
"No, I don't suppose you do; but mind,
there's to be no harm done&mdash;no sousing him,
or anything of that sort.  If it's just a bit of
fun, to give Chandos senior a fright, I'll be
in it."
</p>

<p>
"I should think you would, for things are
awfully slow here now.  Tom says you
used to be up to anything, but since Miss
Chandos&mdash;"
</p>

<p>
"There, we won't talk about that; Tom
knows all about it, if you don't."  And I was
just turning away when Frank Chandos ran
towards us with his skates in his hand, looking
angry and defiant at his brother, who had
followed him half across the playground.
</p>

<p>
A few minutes afterwards we started for
the ponds in groups and knots of twos and
threes, all laughing and chattering together,
the masters at the head, and leading the way
to the broadest and shallowest.
</p>

<p>
"Now, boys, I think you can skate and
slide to your hearts' delight here; but mind,
Dr. Mellor has given orders that no one is to
go to the pond round by the alder bushes, for
there are dangerous holes in it, as you all
know, and if the ice should break&mdash;well,
you know what the consequences are likely
to be."
</p>

<p>
"All right, sir, we'll keep clear of that,"
said two or three, as they were fastening the
straps of their skates, while some, who had
already begun sliding, laughed at the notion
of the ice breaking.
</p>

<p>
"It is as firm as the schoolroom floor, and
one is as likely to give way as the other."
</p>

<p>
"I don't believe the governor would have
let us come here at all if all the ponds hadn't
been safe," I said.
</p>

<p>
"Safe! of course they're safe.  The
governor knows that; only he must tell us
something by way of a scare.  He's as bad
as Miss Chandos," said Tom.
</p>

<p>
"Where is the young lady," I said, "and
the youngster?  We must look after them."
</p>

<p>
We were off now spinning across the pond,
Tom and I, with Jackson close behind, and
the three of us managed to keep together.
</p>

<p>
"What a lark it would be to take Chandos
junior to the alder pond," said Jackson,
looking at me as he wheeled round on his skates.
</p>

<p>
"We'll do it," I said; "but not just now.
Wait a bit, till the fellows get warm to the
work, and they won't miss us.  We must keep
our eye on the youngster.  Is he skating or
sliding?"
</p>

<p>
"Skating; but that don't matter," said Tom.
</p>

<p>
"No, but if Chandos senior had the skates
on it would be all the better.  They are his
skates too; I happen to know that, and so I
shall tell Master Frank presently that he
ought not to stick to them for the whole afternoon."
</p>

<p>
"I see; if Chandos senior should happen
to see us he will not be able to fly to the
rescue of his duckling at once.  But look
here, Stewart, we'll manage so that he don't
know anything about it."
</p>

<p>
"Oh, no, we won't!  I want him to see us,
to tease him a bit.  I say, Jackson, are you a
judge of ice?  Don't you think this seems to
be giving a bit?" I said.
</p>

<p>
"No, it's as firm as a rock.  What ice would
give in such a cutting wind as this?"  And
Jackson pulled his comforter closer round his
throat as he spoke.
</p>

<p>
We were all pretty well wrapped up in
great-coats and mufflers and worsted gloves,
so that when we had a fall, as most of us did
every few minutes, we had something to break
the concussion a little; but these heavy things
would prove rather awkward if the ice should
break and let us through.
</p>

<p>
I said something about this to Jackson, but
he laughed at the notion, and Tom said,
"Why, what has come to you lately, Charley?
You have been tied to Miss Chandos's
apron-string until you have got to be a coward.  I
believe now you are afraid to go to the alder
pond."
</p>

<p>
"Am I? you shall see about that.  Where's
Chandos junior?"  And I wheeled off at once
to look for the youngster and see what Miss
Chandos was about, and whether Swain was
likely to have his eye upon our movements.
</p>

<p>
I cannot write any more to-day.  To-morrow
I shall be stronger, I hope, and then I may
finish this story about our skating.

<h3>
CHAPTER IV.
<br />
THE ACCIDENT.
</h3>

<p>
February 5th.&mdash;It helps to pass some of
the time I am obliged to spend alone to
write in my log, and so I will go on
from where I left off yesterday.
</p>

<p>
I found everybody was on the ice, the
masters enjoying the fun as much as the
boys, and Chandos the merriest of the lot.
He and two or three of his friends were racing,
curveting, cutting figures in the ice, for I
found that Frank had been glad to give up
the skates and take to sliding.
</p>

<p>
"It's rather crowded here," I said, as I ran
the youngster down, and then stopped and
wheeled round to help him up.
</p>

<p>
"It's crowded everywhere, and the fellows
with skates seem to think they ought to have
it all their own way," he grumbled.
</p>

<p>
"Come over here; there are some good
slides at the farther end of the pond;" and
I helped the youngster over, purposely going
close to Miss Chandos.
</p>

<p>
But she didn't smell mischief, or was too
much occupied with her own fun to notice us,
and we soon came up with Jackson and the
rest.
</p>

<p>
"It's dreadfully cold here," said young
Chandos, shivering.
</p>

<p>
"Yes, it is cold," said Tom; "the wind
sweeps down upon us, freezing our very
marrow if we don't keep moving."
</p>

<p>
"The best place for sliding would be the
alder pond.  That is sheltered a good deal
from this cutting wind," said Jackson.
</p>

<p>
"But it isn't safe," said Frank Chandos.
</p>

<p>
"Safe!  As if they'd let us come near
this place at all if all the ponds were not
safe!  I tell you it will bear as well as this,"
said Jackson.
</p>

<p>
"Shall we go there?" proposed Tom.
</p>

<p>
"Mr. Swain said we were not to go near it,"
feebly ventured Frank.
</p>

<p>
"Oh, well, if you're afraid, stay where you
are, but I'm going," said Jackson.  "Stewart,
will you come?  Tom will, I know."
</p>

<p>
"Yes, I'm off," said Tom, nodding to me;
but I wanted Miss Chandos to see where we
were taking her duckling, to give her a fright.
</p>

<p>
The youngster saw me looking towards his
brother, and said, in a whisper, "If we mean
to go, Eustace had better not see us.  You're
sure it's safe?" he added.
</p>

<p>
"Safe as the schoolroom floor," I said; and
then we went after the others; but I kept
looking back towards Miss Chandos as we
went towards the alder pond.
</p>

<p>
We got out of sight as soon as we could,
and, screened by the close-growing trees, the
bitter east wind did not sting us quite so
much.  Jackson and Tom were soon skimming
across the pond.
</p>

<p>
"I wonder where the holes are they make
such a fuss about?" said Tom.
</p>

<p>
"I don't believe there are any," said Jackson.
</p>

<p>
"Well, holes or no holes, I think we had
better keep near the edge," I said; but young
Chandos did not hear me, he says, and went
at once towards the trees for shelter from the
wind.  The ice was very thin there, and the
next minute there was a crack, a splash, and
a scream, and young Chandos had gone
down.
</p>

<p>
"Run for help!" I called to Tom, and then
I skimmed across what I thought was the
strongest part of the ice to help Frank.  But
before I could reach him the ice gave way,
and we were both struggling for life.
</p>

<p>
I don't remember much of what happened
beyond telling Frank to catch hold of some
of the branches of the trees that were close to
the water, and hearing the shouts of the boys
when Tom gave the alarm.  I could hear
them coming, but it would be too late to save
me, for my heavy clothes kept me down in
the water, and I sank, never to rise again, I
thought.  I seemed to see my mother at that
moment more plainly than I had ever seen
her before, and to understand her grief for my
death in a way that I could not have thought
possible.  But still, although I longed to
escape for her sake, I seemed bound by
invisible fetters that were, in reality, my heavy
wet clothes.  They have told me since that
this probably saved me, although they thought
I was dead when they got me out of the water.
</p>

<p>
Once out, however, I soon began to revive,
for I am strong and healthy; but poor Frank
Chandos lay hovering between life and death
for nearly a week afterwards.  I shall never
forget that terrible time.  I felt if he died I
should be a murderer, for he would never
have gone to the alder pond if I had not
taken him there.  Poor Miss Chandos, too,
who had promised his mother to take good
care of the lad, he was almost stunned with
grief; and it was not until after his mother
had come that he could be persuaded to
leave his brother even for five minutes.  Tom
and the other fellows who came to see me
told me all about it, for I was ill too, from
cold and fright, but nothing to cause any
alarm, and little notice was taken of me or
my ailments, and I did not let any one know
how miserably unhappy I was.  I tried to
talk to Tom about it once, but he only
laughed, and said, "Oh, it's no good crying
over spilt milk; let's forget all that miserable
affair now.  Of course we were all in the
wrong box, I suppose; but then it was only
done for a lark, and we've all been punished
for it pretty stiffly.  Jackson and I had a
hundred lines of Milton to learn in after hours
that took no end of time to get perfect, for
the governor was so crabby he wouldn't let
us off a single word, and actually heard us
himself, so if you don't think that has squared
accounts for us, then I don't know what
will."
</p>

<p>
"If learning two hundred lines would square
things, I'd do it; but think of poor Frank
Chandos lying there dying, and all our
fault."
</p>

<p>
"How can it be our fault?  We didn't
carry him to the pond.  He came to please
himself, and if he wasn't ill he'd have an
imposition as well as us.  I wonder whether the
Doctor will give you one when you get well,
Charley?"
</p>

<p>
"I wish he would," I said, bitterly.
"Oh, I dare say it's all very well for you
to talk when it isn't likely to happen, for I
expect the governor will think it punishment
enough for you to be kept up here and fed
on slops for ever so long.  I don't know
myself that I would not rather have the
imposition."
</p>

<p>
How glad I was when poor Chandos came
to see me at last.  I almost wished we really
had been girls then, that I might have thrown
my arms round his neck and kissed him and
asked him to forgive me, for I could see he
felt sorry for me, and the first words he spoke
were meant to comfort me, only somehow
they seemed to make me miserable.
</p>

<p>
"You did not mean to do any harm,
Stewart, I know," he said, his voice shaking
as he spoke.
</p>

<p>
"Will he die?" I asked.  "It don't matter
about me and what I meant about it, but tell
me about him; is there any hope, Chandos?"
</p>

<p>
"Not much, I am afraid.  Only God can
save him; the doctor can do no more, he
says.  Stewart, you'll pray for him, won't
you&mdash;pray that God will give him back to
my mother, for she is almost heartbroken
over it?"
</p>

<p>
"Me pray!  What is the good?  I don't
know how; I never prayed in my life.  I've
said my prayers; but it's different, that is,
from what you mean, and I haven't done that
since I was a little chap."
</p>

<p>
"Then begin again now, Stewart.  Pray
for poor Frank.  I know you feel unhappy
about him."
</p>

<p>
"Yes, I do.  I'd do anything I could; but
that's just it; I can't do anything, and it
seems mean to go sneaking to God now,
when I didn't care a pin about the whole
business until I got into this trouble; and I
can't do it."
</p>

<p>
"Oh, but you mustn't think of it&mdash;think of
God in that way.  If you had been very ill
you would have liked your mother sent for,
wouldn't you? and she would have liked to
come, I am sure."
</p>

<p>
"Yes, I expect there will be a row that she
was not sent for as it is.  But what has that
to do with it?"
</p>

<p>
"Everything.  God feels as kindly towards
us as our mother and father, and He wants us
to go to Him when we are in trouble, although
we may have kept away before.  My mother
says He often sends trouble to be His
messenger and make us come, so that He will not
be offended if you should begin to pray now."
</p>

<p>
"I can't, Chandos.  It's just the meanest
business I ever heard of to go sneaking to
God whenever I'm in trouble and can't help
myself, and forget Him directly afterwards."
</p>

<p>
"But why should you forget Him afterwards?
Why not make Him your Friend, as
He desires to be?"
</p>

<p>
"What, be religious and grumpy, and lose
all the fun of life?" I said, staring at Chandos
in amazement.
</p>

<p>
"You need not be grumpy, Stewart, and
you can have just as much fun, only I think
you will be more careful not to let the fun do
harm to other people."
</p>

<p>
"Well, I will be more careful in future, I
promise you that, Chandos; but about being
religious, why, I never heard of a schoolboy
being religious unless he was a dreadful muff
and a sneaking prig, and I hate sneaks of all
sorts."
</p>

<p>
"So do I," said Chandos; "and if I thought
praying to God and trying to live in fear and
love of Him would make you one, I wouldn't
ask you to do it.  But it won't.  Look here,
you've heard of General Havelock, haven't
you? and Hedley Vicars, that fought in the
Crimean war?  Did you ever hear that they
were sneaks, or anything but brave, noble
men&mdash;brave enough to serve God openly and
fearlessly?  I tell you, Stewart, it takes a brave
man, not a coward, to declare himself
determined to serve God.  But I have said enough
about this, perhaps, and you look tired."
</p>

<p>
"My head aches," I said; "but I should
soon be all right if I could only know there
was a chance for poor Frank to get better
too."
</p>

<p>
"I wish I had better news for you, Stewart.
My mother and I can only pray for him."
</p>

<p>
Chandos was going away as he said this,
but I caught his hand and held him back.
"I will pray too," I whispered; "but if God
hears me now, how shall I ever keep square
afterwards? and I must, you know, to keep
from being a sneak."
</p>

<p>
"Look here, Stewart; you are mistaken
altogether in thinking God's service such a
dreadful bondage.  He knows you are a boy,
and does not expect you to be prim and
precise and always praying and singing psalms.
I am not sure that it would not displease Him
if you tried to do that, for He knows it would
be a poor preparation for our work in the
world by-and-by."
</p>

<p>
"But what would He want me to do, then?"
I said.
</p>

<p>
"First of all to think of Him as your friend.
The Lord Jesus was a boy Himself once, you
know, and so He knows all about a boy's
feelings and temptations.  Almost my father's
last words to me were, 'Be honest and upright
and pure;' and I know God will help me
to keep my father's command if I seek His
help, as He will you if you will take Him to
be your Friend."
</p>

<p>
"And isn't that what I want?" I said; "to
be honest and upright and pure?"
</p>

<p>
"I believe you do, Stewart, and it's what
God wants you to be, and what He will help
you to be if you will let Him."
</p>

<p>
"But what else must I do?  Religious
folks always are different from others, you
know."
</p>

<p>
"Well, they ought to be.  A religious sailor
ought to be the bravest and most fearless man
on board the ship, and do his work better and
more cheerfully than anybody else."
</p>

<p>
"Well, my uncle did tell me of a fellow
like that once, and I thought I should like all
my sailors to be like him.  He was a jolly,
good-natured chap, ready to spin a yarn to
his mates, and they were willing to listen to
the moral he always contrived to bring in.
He was as brave as a lion, too, and yet as
kind as a woman if any of the others were
sick.  But there ain't many like him, you
know, Chandos."
</p>

<p>
"You might make another, Stewart; and a
captain&mdash;you mean to be a captain, you
know&mdash;and a captain of that pattern might do as
much, or even more, good than a common
sailor."
</p>

<p>
"Yes, but it's the beginning.  I don't see
that boys have anything to do with religion.
What can they do?"
</p>

<p>
"Learn better&mdash;learn their lessons more
thoroughly, so as to be better fitted to do
their work in the world by-and-by.  I
suppose you'll admit that we shall be men
by-and-by if we are spared?"
</p>

<p>
"Well, yes, of course; but then it's just
that.  Religion seems to be for those who
don't live, to prepare them for death and all
that, you know.  If I was very ill and dying
I should want to be religious, of course, but
now&mdash;"
</p>

<p>
"That's quite a mistake, Stewart, to suppose
that because you are likely to live many years
this matter of serving God ought to be put
off.  I might ask you how you can be sure
that you will live even six months longer, or
that you may not be carried off by some
sudden accident.  But I don't like to think of
religion as just something to sneak out of the
world comfortably with.  Religion is to fit us
to live&mdash;to live well, to fill life full of joy and
happiness.  You stare, Stewart, but I can tell
you the happiest people in the world to-day
are those who serve God best."
</p>

<p>
"Then what makes them pull such long
faces, and look so wretched, and talk about
being miserable sinners?" I asked.
</p>

<p>
"Well, we are sinners, you know, Stewart,
and one of the first things we have to learn in
coming to God is just this very thing.  It is
because we have sinned that Christ died to
put away our sins; but some people don't seem
to believe in this thoroughly.  They know
they are sinners, and it makes them unhappy
and they fancy they ought to go mourning
over them all the days of their life."
</p>

<p>
"That's just my Aunt Phoebe, and mamma
says she is very religious, and one of the best
women that ever lived, which makes me say I
hate good women, and all religious people
into the bargain.  But, Chandos, there are not
many of your sort of religious people in the
world."
</p>

<p>
"More than you think for.  There are some
of the fellows here in this school; I won't
mention any names, but two of the best and
jolliest in the cricket-field will be just such
men, I believe."
</p>

<p>
"Boys here in this school are religious!" I
said.  "Of course, I know you are, but&mdash;"
</p>

<p>
"You thought I was the only one, Stewart?
Well, now, I'm glad to say when I came here I
found one or two trying to solve the problem
you think so improbable&mdash;how a schoolboy
can serve God; and though it may be difficult
sometimes&mdash;I grant you that, for temptation
to do wrong even in fun must be resisted;
and then lessons must be learned fairly, not
shirked, and no cribs must be used, or else
where is our honesty?  But still, if a boy once
starts to keep on the square all round, things
are not so hard as you might think.  But I
must not stop any longer now, Stewart; I
will come in and have another chat by-and-by.
But&mdash;but you will not forget to pray for poor
Frank?"
</p>

<p>
Forget!  Sometimes I wish I could forget
that dreadful day and everything that
happened then.  It isn't often, I suppose, that
such dreadful things happen through a little
fun, or else it would help Chandos's argument
about the happiness of not doing wrong even
in fun, for this has made me miserable enough.
I wish I could be the sort of fellow Chandos
talked about.  It's different altogether from
what I thought, and to be fair and square and
honest right through in lessons and everything
else has nothing of the sneak about it.  But I
have promised I'd pray for Frank, and I mean
to do it.  How am I to begin?  Will God
hear me?  I'm not good like Chandos.  He
saw me shooting the pellets at him from
under the bedclothes only a little while ago,
I suppose, and won't He think I'm mocking
Chandos now if I kneel down as he did?
What was it that he said, though, about the
Lord Jesus being a boy once?  Well, if He
was He'll know all about me, and after all it's
poor Frank I want Him to help.  I wouldn't
venture to ask Him to help me yet; I want
nothing now so much as for Frank to get well.
</p>

<p>
After thinking like this for some time I
locked the door, for fear anybody should come
in and see me, and then I kneeled down; but
I don't know what I said, only that it was
about Frank and his getting well, and that
I'd try and do the square thing, and be honest
and upright and pure right through, if God
would only make him well again.
</p>

<h3>
CHAPTER V.
<br />
CRIBS.
</h3>

<p>
February 10th.&mdash;I am in the schoolroom
again, and poor Frank Chandos is
getting better.  He is to go away as soon
as he can be moved, but he is too weak even
to sit up in bed yet.  I went to see him
yesterday, and Chandos told him I had
prayed that God would make him well again.
He turned his white face round, and looked at
me with his big, dark eyes, and said, "Thank
you, Stewart."
</p>

<p>
"Oh, don't do that!  I didn't mean to do
any harm, you know, but I led you into the
mischief, and I've been sorry enough ever
since; and I hope you'll forgive me, Chandos,"
I said.
</p>

<p>
But I felt almost frightened when he put
out his hand and slipped it into mine&mdash;such a
thin, white hand it was, with fingers for all
the world like claws.  I suppose the doctors
know best, but I should have thought he was
dying if Mrs. Chandos had not told me he
was looking better.
</p>

<p>
Chandos seems to expect that I'm going in
for plenty of grind, and all that sort of thing.
Well, it's only fair, for I couldn't think of
asking God to help me out of a scrape, and
then forgetting all about it as soon as it's
over; though what a schoolboy can pray
about when things are all right I don't know.
Of course, I haven't done with Frank yet, for
I don't feel so sure about his getting well
as the others do.  He looks awfully thin and
white, and if God was just to leave off making
him well for a day or two he'd be as bad as
ever, I expect.
</p>

<p>
February 12th.&mdash;It's awful hard work to
grind away like this&mdash;as I have the last two
days.  It ain't so easy to do lessons on the
square, when one has been using cribs for ever
so long; and then, grind as much as you may,
the lessons don't look so well after all when
one is a duffer at them, as I am.  Yesterday I
sat poring over one book for hours and hours,
trying to make out what it meant.  I suppose
I ought to know well enough by this time, for
I've learned it all up to there; but then I've
used cribs, and Swain don't know that, and so
he pitched into me, and threatened a heavy
imposition if ever I took up such another
piece of construing.  It's easy enough talking
about always doing the square thing, and
it mightn't be so hard if I'd always done it;
but I haven't, and there's the rub.
</p>

<p>
February 16th.&mdash;There's no end of a row
with the fellows over these cribs.  I've always
used them, and I always shall, they say; and
Tom backs them, and tells them I'm tied to
Miss Chandos's apron-strings.
</p>

<p>
It began about another wretched construe I
handed in to Swain.
</p>

<p>
"Is this your own work, Stewart?" asked
Swain; and I thought it was so good he
could hardly believe I had done it, and I said,
quite proudly, "Yes, sir, I've done every word
of it."
</p>

<p>
"Then all I can say is, you have no right
to be in this division of the school; and I
shall talk to the Doctor about it."  He was
turning over the leaves of the exercise-book
while he was talking; and presently, turning
up one of the cribs, he said, "Look here,
Stewart; who did this?"
</p>

<p>
"I wrote that a month ago, sir," I said.
</p>

<p>
"Yes, I know you wrote it, but who did the
construing?"
</p>

<p>
I looked at Swain, and then at the map on
the wall, for I didn't know who had done it.
I always did my lessons with Tom and the
rest, and they managed the cribs somehow,
and I just copied them off the slips of paper
Jackson or some of the fellows handed to me.
</p>

<p>
"You have been using cribs, sir," thundered
Swain; and then he looked round at the
other fellows, who were all very busy over
their books.
</p>

<p>
I wished for once that the schoolroom floor
was like the ice on the alder pond, and I
could slip through out of sight, for I couldn't
tell a direct lie about it; and Swain had
cornered me so that there was no other way
of getting out of it.  So I said nothing,
though I knew I should catch it from Tom
and the rest when we got into the playground,
for I could see by Swain's looks that he
suspected cribs had been used by all the lot.
</p>

<p>
"You may go to your seat now, Stewart,
and I will see Dr. Mellor about this," he said
at last.
</p>

<p>
As soon as ever we got into the playground
the row began with the other fellows.
</p>

<p>
"Look here, you miserable muff! what
right have you to get us all into this awful
scrape?" said Jackson, pulling off his jacket
ready to fight.
</p>

<p>
"Who says I'm a miserable muff?" I said,
looking round at the others who had gathered
near.
</p>

<p>
"Well, Charley, it was mean of you not to
open your mouth when you might have saved
us all by a single word.  Swain would have
believed you if you'd said, 'I haven't been
cribbing;' and it wouldn't have been
much of a fib either, for you haven't cribbed
for nearly a month, I know."
</p>

<p>
"No, because I haven't done many lessons
lately.  You may call it a fib if you like, but
I call it a lie, and you know I hate lying,
Tom, as you did a little while ago.  Now,
Jackson, do you want to fight it out?" I asked,
beginning to roll up my shirt-sleeves.
</p>

<p>
"No, no, don't fight; things are bad enough
now, and the governor will be furious if he
hears you have been fighting," said Tom; and
he caught hold of Jackson and held him back.
</p>

<p>
"Try and settle it without fighting," said
one of the other fellows.  "I don't suppose
Stewart meant to get us into a row."
</p>

<p>
"No, I didn't," I said.  "I only wanted to
go on the square for myself."
</p>

<p>
"One of Miss Chandos's tricks for serving
us out," I heard Jackson whisper to Tom,
</p>

<p>
"Well, that's all very well, you see, Stewart,
but you've been using cribs with us for ever
so long, and so you must stick to them now."
</p>

<p>
"I shan't," I said.  "I mean to act on the
square."
</p>

<p>
"Go on the square for anything else you
like, but you mustn't throw us overboard in
this crib business.  We're all in the same boat,
you see, Charley, and it won't do; the other
fellows don't like it."
</p>

<p>
"Then they can lump it," I said; and I was
turning away, but Tom ran after me.
</p>

<p>
"Now, be reasonable, old fellow; I've stuck
up for you," he said, "for Jackson and the
rest wanted to kick up a row as soon as they
found you were doing your lessons on the
square; but I said, 'Let him be a bit, and have
his own way; he'll soon be glad of cribs
again.'"
</p>

<p>
"But I don't mean to have anything to do
with them again, I tell you, Tom; it's
downright dishonest."
</p>

<p>
"Hoighty toighty&mdash;dishonest!  You'll tell
us next we're all thieves!" said Tom, angrily.
</p>

<p>
"What's that he says?" asked Collins, who
happened to hear the last words.
</p>

<p>
"Oh, he's setting up for a Solomon after
the Chandos pattern; says we are all
dishonest&mdash;little better than thieves, of course."
</p>

<p>
"What do you mean, Stewart?" said
Collins, turning upon me fiercely.
</p>

<p>
"Just what I say&mdash;what I told Tom&mdash;it
isn't honest to use cribs, and I've done with
them."
</p>

<p>
"You'll have to ask us about that now,
Stewart; we've helped you, and we'll do it
again, though you have served us this shabby
trick, for it won't do, you know, to have
another kick-up with Swain about your
wretched construing.  This may blow over,
but the next won't, and then we shall all be
in for it."
</p>

<p>
"Why don't you give the muff a good
pommelling?" said Jackson; "he's done no end
of mischief.  It's no better than peaching to
serve us such a shabby trick.  Swain suspects
us, I know."
</p>

<p>
"Look here, Jackson, a fight will just bring
the whole thing out, and we shall all be
condemned to no end of grind if it does.  There'll
be no time for the playground or cricket-field
or anything else; we shall just be worked like
galley-slaves, for the governor will have all
the old lessons done over again by way of
extra impositions.  I know him better than
you; but if you'll just keep cool and take my
advice we may all escape."
</p>

<p>
"Now then, boys, listen to the words of the
sage," said one of the fellows, elbowing his
way to the front.
</p>

<p>
"Go on, Collins, make us a speech," said another.
</p>

<p>
"It ain't much of a speech.  You must
give up cribs now."
</p>

<p>
"Oh, that's all cram; we can't do it," said Tom.
</p>

<p>
"We must."
</p>

<p>
"We shall all look as interesting as Stewart
did to-day when we go up.  I say, why didn't
you put your finger in your mouth, Stewart?"
he asked.
</p>

<p>
I was too angry to answer, but the rest
burst into a loud laugh, and I punched one
fellow's head, but Collins wouldn't let us have
a fair stand-up fight, and so I walked away,
leaving them to settle about the cribs as they
liked; but Tom came to me afterwards, and
said that the fellows had agreed to use no
more cribs for a fortnight, but after that I
must do as the rest did, or they would send
me to Coventry.
</p>

<p>
February 20th.&mdash;Mrs. Chandos is still here
nursing Frank.  I go into his room to see
him every day for a few minutes; but there
isn't time for anything now except on half-holidays,
for it is grind, grind, grind all day
long, and the worst of it is we get impositions,
and the masters are cross because all the
construing is done so badly.  I wonder who
invented cribs.  It's an easy way of getting
over the lessons at first, but a fellow is nicely
floored if he has to do without them for a bit,
as we have just now.  I fancy, too, that Swain
suspects what is going on, and is watching to
catch some of us, for we have heard nothing
since the day of the row&mdash;not a word more
about my being sent to the governor.
</p>

<p>
I wish it wasn't so hard to do everything
on the square.  Chandos says I find it hard
because I made a bad beginning when I
came here, and the longer I go on without
altering this the harder it will be to alter.  He
gave me quite a lecture about this last
night&mdash;about everything in my life depending upon
the sort of beginning I make now.  I laughed,
and told him he ought to be a parson, and I
should expect to see him preaching at some
street corner if they wouldn't give him a
gown and pulpit; but though I laughed I
cannot help thinking he may be right after
all.  I suppose these lessons they give us to
learn will be useful in some way, and when I
leave school I shall be supposed to know all
about them, as Swain thinks I know all about
the construing in my exercise-book, and it
may be more awkward by-and-by not to
know it than it is now.  I'll try to think of
this.  Dear old Chandos, I like to tease him
a bit about his lectures, and yet I like him to
talk to me as he does.
</p>

<p>
I can understand now how it is he is so
grave and quiet.  He is the eldest son, and
his mother talks to him as though he was
Frank's father.  What a pity it is he cannot
have his wish and be a doctor.  It's cruel, I
think, that people can't have their own way
about things like this.  I couldn't give up
going to sea, as Chandos has given up his
wish.
</p>

<p>
March 4th.&mdash;The fortnight is up, and cribs
are coming in fashion again, but everybody is
very careful, for Swain is still on the look-out,
I can see.  Last night I had a talk with
Chandos about it, and he says if I am firm
the boys will not send me to Coventry, as
they threaten.  Jackson and a few others may
bully me a bit, but the school will not be led
by them.
</p>

<p>
To tell the truth, I am not so much afraid
of Jackson and that lot as of the endless
grind I shall have to do to keep on the
square and do without cribs.  I wish I'd
never begun with them, and it wouldn't be so
hard now, but once begun, it seems almost
impossible to leave them off.
</p>

<p>
I said something of this to Chandos, and
he said if I asked God's help I should not
find things so difficult; but I don't see how
praying can help me with my lessons or
make them any easier, but still I mean to
keep on.
</p>

<p>
March 12th.&mdash;The fellows are awfully rusty
because I won't use cribs.  Yesterday Tom
came to talk to me about it&mdash;the first time
he has spoken for a week, for most of the
fellows have kept their word, and sent me to
Coventry for it.
</p>

<p>
"Now look here, Charley, the fellows have
sent me to speak to you once more&mdash;mind,
it's the last time&mdash;and if you ain't reasonable
now you won't have another chance."
</p>

<p>
"If it is about cribs you can hold your
tongue, for I've made up my mind long ago,"
I said.
</p>

<p>
"Oh, that's all cram.  It won't do to come
over us with that tale, you know, Charley;
you've used 'em for months and months before
you came here, I know, and you'll be glad
enough to use 'em again; but you'll find then
the fellows won't help you, and so I've come
to give you one more chance.  Now then, yes
or no?"
</p>

<p>
"No," I said, firmly.
</p>

<p>
"Oh, I'm not going to take your answer in
such a hurry as all that.  Just think a bit, old
fellow, what you'll do when the summer comes,
and you have to sit stewing over your lessons
in that musty old class-room while we are in
the cricket-field.  Why, you'll never get that
big ship of yours finished unless you take to
cribs again."
</p>

<p>
"I can't help it," I said, sulkily, and wishing
all the time I could get my lessons done
sooner.
</p>

<p>
"Oh yes, you can, and you needn't think
to cram me with the tale that you are fond of
grind, because I know better.  You hate it
like poison, and if you weren't afraid of Miss
Chandos and her slow-going lot you'd take to
cribs again like a sensible fellow."
</p>

<p>
"Who says I'm afraid of Chandos?"
</p>

<p>
"I do, and so do the other fellows; and
she's just taking all the spirit out of you,
and making you as big a coward as she is
herself."
</p>

<p>
"I tell you, Tom, you're mistaken in thinking
Chandos is a coward, and I'll fight any
fellow that dares to say so."
</p>

<p>
"Oh, everybody knows you can fight, but
that isn't the thing.  I haven't come to quarrel
with you, Charley, but to talk over this.
Look here now, things are getting awfully
dull and slow.  We haven't had a real good
lark this half, for all our time has to be spent
in grind."
</p>

<p>
"You and Collins and Jackson always get
done in good time."
</p>

<p>
"Yes, and a few others besides, but some of
them talk about giving up cribs through you,
and it ain't fair.  Swain will find out about
the cribs if you are so much longer over your
lessons than we are.  Mind, this isn't the only
thing, Charley.  We're old chums&mdash;"
</p>

<p>
"We were at one time, Tom, but I can't
forget that farm-yard business," I put in.
</p>

<p>
"Oh, botheration to the farm-yard!  That
was months and months ago, and everybody
has forgotten that, if you haven't."
</p>

<p>
"I'm not so sure of that, Tom," I said.
</p>

<p>
Tom put his hands into his pockets and
whistled.  After a minute or two he said,
"Well, Charley, you'll never be the sailor I
thought you would."
</p>

<p>
"Bother being a sailor!  What's that got
to do with it?" I said.  "You were talking
about our being chums."
</p>

<p>
"Well, only this&mdash;sailors don't bear malice
like you."
</p>

<p>
"I don't bear malice.  It isn't that at all.
You didn't hurt me, except that I felt I'd lost
my old chum, when you did that sneaking
business, and let Chandos take your punishment."
</p>

<p>
"Oh, bother Chandos!  I'm sick of hearing
the young lady's name, and I didn't come to
talk about her, but about these cribs.  I tell
you, Charley, if you don't take them up again
there'll be no fun this half."
</p>

<p>
"We can live without fun, I suppose," I
said, crossly.
</p>

<p>
"I suppose we can, but you were always up
to anything in that line.  But now&mdash;well, there's
been nothing since the skating but just
maundering about like a parcel of girls."
</p>

<p>
"Would you like that skating business over
again?&mdash;because I shouldn't!  I do like a good
lark as well as anybody, but I may as well
tell you straight out, Tom, I mean to go on
the square with our larks as well as with
lessons.  I shan't forget how near Frank
Chandos was to dying for one while, and I
mean to be careful in that direction for the
future, for I shouldn't like to be a murderer,
even in fun."

<h3>
CHAPTER VI.
<br />
WAS IT ROBBERY?
</h3>

<p>
April 13th.&mdash;A month since I wrote up
my log.  I have been home for a few
days' holiday, but the rest has been all
grind, and not a single lark.  I'm afraid I
shan't be able to hold out much longer; and
yet it seems jolly mean when God has made
Frank Chandos almost well, and saved me
from being miserable all my life.
</p>

<p>
I had a letter from Frank yesterday, and
he says he can run about&mdash;clamber over the
rocks and build castles in the sand now.  I
wish I was at the seaside, though it would be
better to be on the sea.  I shall run away
soon to get away from this grind if something
don't happen, though I'm not sure that it
wouldn't be as mean as cribbing.  The fellows
have sent me to Coventry over that, and
everything is as dull as can be.  I wish
something would happen; even a row would be a
change.
</p>

<p>
April 20th.&mdash;Something has happened, or is
going to happen, at least; and I've laughed
so much already over it that my sides ached.
Yesterday morning I heard a knocking at our
bedroom door just before the dressing-bell
rang.
</p>

<p>
"Who's there?" I called out.
</p>

<p>
"Hush up and come out here," came a
whisper through the keyhole.
</p>

<p>
I knew it was Tom, and though I felt
inclined to give him a turn at Coventry at
first, I got up and opened the door.
</p>

<p>
"Now then, what's the row?  Have you
set all the water-jugs on fire?" I asked.
</p>

<p>
"We want you in our room a minute.  Is
Miss Chandos asleep?" he added.
</p>

<p>
"It ain't likely, with all the row you've
been making at this door.  What do you
want, Tom?  You know I'm in Coventry."
</p>

<p>
"Well, you won't be much longer.  We'll
give up about the cribs, Charley; you've beat
us.  But slip on some of your things and
come into our room.  Collins wants to speak
to you.  He's got some news."
</p>

<p>
"And a hamper too, hasn't he?"
</p>

<p>
"Yes, but there wasn't much besides clothes,
and that's what's put him out."
</p>

<p>
"Does he think I'm to blame, then?" I
said.
</p>

<p>
"No, but he thinks you might help him fill
it.  But come on, Charley, now, before Swain
comes.  We must think of something at once."
</p>

<p>
"I shan't be a minute, Chandos," I said,
slipping my head inside the door; and then I
followed Tom to his room.  This is a good
deal larger than ours, and has six beds in it,
Jackson, Collins, and Tom, with three others,
sleeping here.  They were all perched on
Collins's bed when we went in, talking over
the matter upon which Tom had been dispatched.
</p>

<p>
"I say, Stewart, you'll promise us, first of
all, not to tell what goes on here, even if you
shouldn't join the fun?"
</p>

<p>
"Did you ever know me to turn sneak, any
of you fellows?" I asked, rather angrily.
</p>

<p>
"You need not get your back up, Stewart;
we only asked you a civil question, and you
might give us a civil answer.  It's all right,
though; I don't believe you'd peach."
</p>

<p>
"No, I wouldn't."
</p>

<p>
"Well, I believe you.  Now, look here.
The governor's birthday is on the twenty-fourth,
and we shall have a holiday&mdash;a whole
holiday, this year, as I happen to know; for I
overheard Swain talking about the weather
being unusually fine, and the boys having
worked very steadily lately; they were to have
the whole day to spend at Dinglewell.
You've never been to Dinglewell, have you,
Stewart?"
</p>

<p>
"No, but I've heard about it."
</p>

<p>
"Oh, it's the jolliest place! and we can do
pretty much as we like in the woods.  There's
only one thing they're mean about, and that's
the grub.  Sandwiches and stale buns I don't
relish, especially when I think of the pantry
shelves almost cracking with the good things
at home; for you must know there's always a
grand dinner-party in the evening, and cook
begins preparing for it days beforehand.  I
tell you, Stewart, it's enough to make a
fellow's mouth water to see the pies and tarts
and custards standing there."
</p>

<p>
"You're not obliged to look at them, I
suppose?"
</p>

<p>
"Oh, it's not the looking at them I object to,
but the not tasting; and I mean to remedy
that this year.  Are you game for a lark?"
</p>

<p>
"Just try me, that's all!" I said.
</p>

<p>
"Charley's good for any lark that don't
hurt anybody," said Tom.
</p>

<p>
"Then this will fit him as nicely as
possible, for nobody will be hurt.  Even the
governor himself will laugh over it, and we
shall have a jolly feed into the bargain."
</p>

<p>
"You mean to have some of the pies and
tarts out of cook's pantry, then?"
</p>

<p>
"Exactly, old fellow.  You'd help us, I
know."
</p>

<p>
"What am I to do?" I asked; "and how
are you going to get them away&mdash;put them
in your pockets?"
</p>

<p>
"Pockets be bothered!  No, everybody
knows I had a hamper from home yesterday,
and I mean to let the school think it was
stuffed full of good things, and that I mean to
save them until we go to Dinglewell."
</p>

<p>
"Oh, I see," I said, laughing; but there
wasn't time to say any more, for the bell rang,
and I was obliged to hurry back to my room,
for there's no telling when or where Swain
will turn up in the morning.
</p>

<p>
Chandos looked at me when I got back,
but he would not ask any questions, and of
course I can't split on the other fellows.
</p>

<p>
Later in the day I had another talk with
Collins about clearing the larder, and we
agreed to do it the night before we went to
Dinglewell; and the things were to be packed
in his hamper, and Swain is to be asked
beforehand to let it go in the cart with the
other grub and things.  This is the best of
the whole fun, to think Swain should help us
clear the governor's larder.  I laughed until
Collins declared I should bring it all out and
spoil it.  I wouldn't be out of this fun for
anything.  I only wish I could be at home
when cook finds it out.  I'd give my share of
the fun to see the scare.
</p>

<br />
CLEARING THE LARDER.
</p>

<p>
April 23rd.&mdash;I've only time for a line before
Chandos comes in, and the other fellows don't
want him to know anything of what's going
on.  We've done it&mdash;cleared the larder of
every pie and custard we could get hold of.
I thought we should be caught once, and my
hair almost stood on end as I heard cook's
voice outside the door; but she went on, and
so did we.  I handed the things to Collins
through the window, and each fellow in the
secret took something and stole up to his
room with it, and now they are all safely
packed in the hamper, and Swain has
promised it shall go in the cart.  Poor old
Swain, if he only knew what he had
promised!  But he'll never know that he helped
to clear the governor's pantry, although he'll
pull a long face to-morrow when he comes
home and finds there's precious little to eat.
The best of the fun is, they won't find out
that they're gone until dinner is nearly ready,
for the precious things were packed on the
top shelves out of the way, and I nearly broke
my neck once trying to reach them.  I
wonder what Chandos will say about this
when he hears of it?  He is looking forward
to the fun we shall have in the woods
to-morrow as much as anybody.  I wonder
whether he would think this innocent fun?
I don't think I shall go to the feed, though
I helped to get the things, for Collins won't
ask him, which I think is rather mean of him,
considering that Chandos had to stay here for
the Easter holidays, while the rest of us went
home for a fortnight.
</p>

<p>
I wonder what we shall do with the dishes
when we've eaten the pies!  We can't bring
'em home, that's certain, and Swain mustn't
see them either, and he'll expect to be invited,
for Collins has pitched him a fine yarn about
the things his mother has sent for this feed.
I must ask Collins what he means to do
about this, for if we don't look out the
crockery will spoil the whole game.  What
a pity it is they can't make pies without
dishes!  I almost wish I'd only brought those
little tarts that Collins carried away in his
handkerchief.  They got broken a bit, and
some of the jam ran out, but they're just as
good broken as whole, and there's no dishes
to worry about.  Bother the dishes!  I must
go and speak to him about them before
Chandos comes up.  I wonder why he is
downstairs so long after time.  Surely he
can't have any mischief on hand!
</p>

<p>
April 25th.&mdash;Our holiday is over, and the
fun too; but I'm afraid we haven't heard the
last of the governor's pies.  If he only knew
what a bother they were to us after all, and
how often we wished them back in the pantry
even before we had eaten them, he would feel
more comfortable about it, I should think, for
it's the last time I'll ever have anything to do
with robbing a larder, even for a lark.  It was
all through the dishes.  Nobody knew how
we were to get rid of them, and some of the
fellows got so frightened they wanted to pitch
the whole lot away.  But we couldn't do
that, even if Collins and Jackson would have
agreed to it, for the hamper had gone in the
cart, and we couldn't get at it until Swain
said, soon after we reached Dinglewell,
"Would you like your hamper left with the
other things until dinner-time, Collins?"
</p>

<p>
"I don't think so, sir, Stewart and
Jackson, and a few more of us, are going to look
for ferns, and so we can carry the hamper,
and if we shouldn't get back by dinner-time
it won't matter."
</p>

<p>
"I don't know so much about that," said
Swain, turning rather rusty; "I cannot let you
stray miles off.  You may take the hamper,
of course, but you must not go beyond the
old tower, and then I shall know where to
find you if you are wanted."
</p>

<p>
"The contrary old hunks&mdash;he's never done
that before!" grumbled Collins, as we turned
away, carrying the hamper between us.
</p>

<p>
We didn't feel very jolly about the thing
now, and I wished I could back out of it and
join the football party with Chandos and the
rest.  We might have been carrying a coffin
with the body of somebody we'd killed, by the
solemn way we marched along.  As soon as
we were away from Swain and the rest I said,
"Now let's pitch all the rubbish down the first
hole we can find."
</p>

<p>
"That's your own throat, I suppose, Stewart,"
said Jackson.
</p>

<p>
"No, I don't want a bit; I've had enough
thinking of the dishes," I said.
</p>

<p>
"Oh, hang the dishes!  I wish you hadn't
thought of them at all, or had left them in the
pantry," said Collins.
</p>

<p>
"Well, I like that&mdash;after dragging me into
the scrape to grumble at me for helping!
Now, look here, I've had enough of the fun,
and will give up the feed to you, and go back
to the rest, if you like."
</p>

<p>
"And leave me to take care of the precious
dishes!  I knew you were a coward, Stewart."
</p>

<p>
"No, I'm not a coward, and I'll stay and
see it out, if you like.  We must smash the
dishes up, you know, and throw the bits about.
Swain will never see anything of them then."
</p>

<p>
"Bravo, Charley!  What a pity we hadn't
thought of that before!  Now, then, let's find
a place where we can be sure to be to
ourselves, and when we've cleared out the good
things we'll begin the smashing business."
</p>

<p>
It did not take us long to demolish the pies
and custards, and each dish as it was emptied
was broken into pieces, and we amused
ourselves by throwing these as far as we could in
every direction.
</p>

<p>
It was quite a relief when the last tart was
eaten and the last dish scattered, and I then
proposed returning to the others, for, our
penance over, surely we might have some play
now.
</p>

<p>
"You forget we've come fern-grubbing," said
Collins.  "I propose that, as we have robbed
the governor of his dinner, we should take him
something for his fernery.  It will help to
ward off suspicion, too, I should think; it
ought, I am sure."
</p>

<p>
"I am not at all sure," I said, "and I know
nothing about ferns either."
</p>

<p>
"He wants to get back to his nurse,"
laughed Jackson.
</p>

<p>
"Miss Chandos said he mustn't be long,"
put in Tom, provokingly; but the next minute
he had measured his length on the ground, for
if I did want to have a game with Chandos I
wasn't going to be told of it by Tom.
</p>

<p>
Then the fellows all turned rusty, and
there was something of a fight, until about
the middle of the afternoon we were so tired
of each other and our fruitless search for ferns
that we threw the hamper away and went
back to the rest.
</p>

<p>
"I knew you wouldn't get any ferns," said
Swain, when he heard of the result of our
expedition.  "I suppose you have had your
dinner?" he added, speaking rather stiffly.
</p>

<p>
"Yes, sir," answered Collins; and we were
glad to turn away, for we fancied he looked at
us very suspiciously.
</p>

<p>
We had certainly missed the fun to-day in
our eagerness to grasp it; for seven more
disagreeable, disconsolate boys it would be
hard to find than we, as we sauntered towards
the two football parties, who were running,
shouting, laughing, and evidently enjoying
the game wonderfully.
</p>

<p>
There seemed to be no room for us now,
and we stood about watching the fun as it
grew more fast and furious.  Chandos saw
me at last, and ran across to where I was
standing.
</p>

<p>
"Why, Stewart, where have you been all
day?  What made you run away from this
football?  It has been such glorious play!"
</p>

<p>
"I'm glad you've enjoyed it.  I've been with
Collins and the rest to look for some ferns."
</p>

<p>
"To look for ferns!  Why, Collins must
know that ferns don't grow in Dinglewell
Forest; at least, I never saw any," said
Chandos.
</p>

<p>
"I don't think they do, for we couldn't
find them either, and so we came back."
</p>

<p>
"Well, you'll join the game now, won't
you?  Come on, we'll make room for you."
</p>

<p>
"No, I don't care about it to-day," I said,
for I began to feel a kind of dizziness in my
head.  I had felt sick for the last hour, but
this pain in my head was something quite
new, and I began to fear I should be ill.
Certainly I had no inclination to join in the
<i>mêlée</i> over the ball, and only wanted to be
left alone.
</p>

<p>
The miserable day came to an end at last,
and I was glad enough to go home and go to
bed, and I fancy Tom and one or two of the
others felt as bad as I did, although nobody
complained or even owned to having a
headache, for fear Swain should suspect us when
he heard of the robbery.  Robbery! what an
ugly word that is!  But of course it isn't as
though we really stole things; we only took
the pies for fun, which is different from
common stealing, only we missed the fun
altogether this time.
</p>

<p>
We expected to hear all about the affair
when we came home&mdash;that the cook had gone
into hysterics and the governor fainted, or
something like that; but we did not hear a
single word, and of course we couldn't ask.
</p>

<p>
Yesterday we did hear a little bit from the
housemaid; but she didn't know who the
governor suspected.  She thought it was
burglars, and of course we said it must be,
and sent the whisper through the school that
burglars had broken into the pantry.
</p>

<p>
One of the juniors was so frightened at the
word "robbers," that he went and asked
Swain if he thought they would come any
more, or whether he had better write and ask
his mamma to send for him.
</p>

<p>
"Who has been telling you this tale about
burglars and robbers?  It is nothing to be
afraid of.  Burglars such as you are thinking
of don't come to steal pies and custards.  We
shall find out the thief or thieves very soon,
I have no doubt."
</p>

<p>
I have been wondering ever since I heard
this whether Swain suspects us after all, or
whether he just said it to pacify the youngster.
Not a word has been said about it by the
governor, and so I am inclined to think we
shall get off without any further punishment.
It will only be fair after all, for if the governor
knew how his precious pies spoiled all our
holiday, and how miserable and sick they
made us feel, he wouldn't want to serve us
out any more by way of making us remember
it.  I'm not likely to forget or repeat it again,
for a day like that is worse than the hardest
grind at Euclid.

<h3>
CHAPTER VII.
<br />
A SURPRISE.
</h3>

<p>
April 30th.&mdash;There's been a most awful
row, and the fellows say I turned rat&mdash;at
least, Jackson and Collins have sent
me to Coventry over it; but I should do it
again if there was the same occasion, for how
could I let a poor servant lose her place and
her character through one of my larks?  The
governor must be a drivelling donkey not to
suspect us instead of the servants.
</p>

<p>
I always fancied that Swain did smell a
rat until Young came tearing up to me with
the tale that the police were to be sent for to
search the kitchen-maid's boxes.
</p>

<p>
"Why, what's the row now?" I asked.
</p>

<p>
"They can't find out anything clear about
those pies; but it's pretty certain the
kitchen-maid has been giving away bread and meat,
which, it seems, is against the rules, and they
think she has handed the pies away too&mdash;sold
them, perhaps."
</p>

<p>
"Sold your grandmother!  Young, you're
not such a muff as to think the servants did
that, are you?"
</p>

<p>
"I don't know what to think.  It couldn't
be burglars, you know."
</p>

<p>
"Of course not, it was us.  I did most of
the business, and I'm off to the governor now
to tell him all about it;" and, leaving Young
staring with all his eyes, I rushed indoors past
Swain, who stood near the schoolroom door,
and bolted on to the master's study.  I could
hardly wait for him to say "Come in;" but
when I opened the door all my courage
seemed to have gone, and I felt ready to run
away again.
</p>

<p>
"Did you wish to speak to me, Stewart?"
</p>

<p>
"Yes, sir; please, sir, it's about the pies," I
said, hardly knowing how to begin.
</p>

<p>
"You mean the robbery that has been
committed lately?"
</p>

<p>
"Please, sir, I never thought about it's being
a robbery when I took them."
</p>

<p>
"You took them!  You robbed my pantry,
Stewart?"
</p>

<p>
"It wasn't a robbery, sir&mdash;it was only a
lark.  I did not want the pies to eat; it was
just for the fun."
</p>

<p>
"And what did you do with them?" asked
the governor, sternly.
</p>

<p>
"Well, sir, Mr. Swain helped us get
them away, although he didn't know it;" and
then bit by bit it all came out.  I tried to
screen Collins and the rest, but somehow there
was no getting over the governor's close
questions, and he sent for them, and gave us all a
lecture and then a long imposition.  I hate
impositions and all sorts of grind, but I didn't
mind that so much, for after all the governor
didn't give it us so stiff as he might&mdash;as I
thought he would; and that poor girl is not
to lose her place after all.
</p>

<p>
I thought when the impositions were got
over there would be an end of the affair; but
it seems I shall for ever be nagged about
it&mdash;called a rat, a sneak, a coward.  Tom says I
need not have been in such a hurry to run
off to the governor&mdash;that if the police had
come they would not have found the empty
dishes in her box, and so she would not have
lost her place, and we could still have kept
our secret.
</p>

<p>
Chandos, too, talks something like the
governor.  According to them it was an
actual robbery, although I did it in fun.  The
result was the same, they say, and it might
have led to disastrous consequences if I had
not told the whole truth about it; and then
he went on to say it was not keeping the
promise I had made when Frank was so ill.
</p>

<p>
"Well, how in the world is a fellow to keep
straight for ever?" I said.
</p>

<p>
"What pleasure did you get out of this?"
</p>

<p>
"None at all, as it happened, and it's the
last pantry I'll rob; but still&mdash;" and there I
stopped.
</p>

<p>
"I suppose you mean to say you will get
into some other mischief at the first
opportunity?"
</p>

<p>
"Well, how am I to keep out of it?" I
asked.
</p>

<p>
"What pleasure did you ever get by it?
Now, I know you did not enjoy the holiday at
Dinglewell as I did, and yet&mdash;"
</p>

<p>
"No, that I didn't," I said; "it was the most
miserable day I ever spent, and I'll never rob
a pantry any more, even for fun.  I tell you,
Chandos, I'd like to keep straight if I could,
but how can I?  I've tried, and tried hard, ever
since that affair of poor Frank's.  I've never
touched a crib since, I give you my word, and
you don't know how hard it is to leave off
when once you've begun on that tack."
</p>

<p>
"I know it must be hard work, and I think
you have done very well in resisting as you
have the temptation to use cribs; but you
might have done better, Stewart, if you were
not so proud."
</p>

<p>
"Proud!" I said.  "Nobody ever called
me that before.  Sailors are never proud, you
know."
</p>

<p>
"Well, you are, or you would accept the
help a Friend is waiting to give you if you
were not."
</p>

<p>
"Now, Chandos, that isn't fair," I said.
"I have always been willing to accept help
and take advice from you."
</p>

<p>
"I wasn't speaking of myself, but of One
who cares for you far more than I do, although
I feel sorry enough when you go wrong, and
get into scrapes, and make people miserable,
as you often do through your thoughtlessness."
</p>

<p>
"I suppose you mean my mother?  But I
tell you, Chandos, she expects it&mdash;she knows
boys can't keep out of mischief."
</p>

<p>
"But I know they can; and it wasn't your
mother I was thinking of just now, but God."
</p>

<p>
"But&mdash;but you don't think He cares much
about it, do you, Chandos?  He can't, you
know."
</p>

<p>
"You believe that I care, don't you&mdash;at
least a little?"
</p>

<p>
"Well, yes, I do, for you have always been
my friend, and helped me out of a scrape, and
given me good advice; but&mdash;but it's different
about God," I said.
</p>

<p>
"Why is it different?  He is your Friend,
who cares far more for your welfare than I
do, and He is more anxious to see you do
well&mdash;live a pure, honest, upright life&mdash;than
I can be; and yet you will not accept the help
He alone can give, and by which alone you
can conquer this inclination to get into
mischief and often do such great wrong."
</p>

<p>
"God is my Friend?" I repeated.  "Look
here, Chandos, if I could believe that&mdash;well,
I don't know what I should do, but somehow
I should want to be different.  I almost wish
it could be true."
</p>

<p>
"It is true, Stewart, as true as truth, as true
as you and I are standing here.  I wish you
would believe that God feels a personal
interest in you, as much as though you were
the only schoolboy in the world."
</p>

<p>
"I wish I could.  But somehow, Chandos,
it seems so strange&mdash;too wonderful, you know,
to be true, that God&mdash;the great God who
made heaven and earth&mdash;can care for a
harum-scarum lot like us."
</p>

<p>
"Yes, it is wonderful; but you know the
Lord Jesus Christ cared so much for this
harum-scarum world and all the people in it
that He was content to die&mdash;to lay down His
life to bring them to God."
</p>

<p>
"Yes, I've heard something about it in
church; and since I've been trying to do the
square thing and write bits of the sermon,
I've heard about it there too; but then it
never seemed to me that it could be for boys.
God the friend of boys like me?  Why, look
here, Chandos; if the governor was to proclaim
himself my friend it would be an honour, you
know; but look at the difference!  I take it
that you mean I could go and tell God about
every little scrape and trouble I got into, and
He would help me out of it?"
</p>

<p>
"Or help you to bear it, as the case might be.
That is exactly what I do mean, Stewart."
</p>

<p>
"You do; and you believe it?"
</p>

<p>
"Believe it; of course I believe it.  I don't
know how I should get on if I did not,"
said Chandos; and I am sure he spoke truly.
</p>

<p>
"Well, perhaps I may come to believe it
too some day, but I can't now&mdash;not just in
the way you do.  Of course I know we ought
to pray and do the square thing; but as long
as we do that and go to church it always
seemed to me that God wouldn't trouble
Himself about us any further.  I have been
doing the square thing too lately; at least,
I've tried at it, and isn't that enough?"
</p>

<p>
"But, Stewart, according to your belief, we
should all be the slaves of God&mdash;doing just
what we were obliged, for fear of punishment,
and no more.  God does not ask, will
not accept such service as that.  Don't you
remember the text of last Sunday, 'My son,
give Me thine heart,' and what the minister
said of God desiring our will, our affection to
be given to Him?  The service would follow
then quite naturally, he said; and when I
heard it I was thinking of you&mdash;thinking you
had begun at the wrong end, trying to force
yourself into giving God service without any
heart or love or pleasure in it."
</p>

<p>
"Yes, you're about right, Chandos," I said;
"but I don't see how it could be different.
God made Frank well, and I promised that if
He would do that and save me from being
miserable all my life I'd do the square thing;
and I'm not mean enough to back out of the
bargain if I can help it."
</p>

<p>
"But, Stewart, you do not surely think
that God answered our prayers for Frank
just because He wanted to tie you to this
miserable bondage&mdash;for it is bondage,
slavery&mdash;this service which you know ought to be
and is 'perfect freedom' to those who begin
at the right end, and not the wrong&mdash;by
giving their hearts&mdash;their will and love to
God."
</p>

<p>
"Well, I don't know.  Of course God wants
me to be good, I suppose."
</p>

<p>
"But He would never take such an advantage
of us as you suppose&mdash;making a bargain
with us, as it were.  No, no, Stewart, you
have made a great mistake about this.  God
heard and answered our prayers because He
pitied our distress and loved you too well to let
the miserable consequences of your thoughtless
mischief follow you through all your life; and
you ought to return love for love, and not
treat God as though you thought Him a hard
taskmaster."
</p>

<p>
"Well, I don't know; you may be right,
Chandos, but I don't see how I am to begin.
What a pity it is you are not going to be a
parson!"
</p>

<p>
I couldn't help saying that, and I meant it
too.
</p>

<p>
May 5th.&mdash;Something has happened that I
never thought did happen anywhere except
in books.  Chandos, that so many of the boys
have looked down upon as being poor and
beneath them, because he never seemed to
have any pocket money to spend, like the rest
of us, has suddenly become a baronet&mdash;Sir
Eustace Chandos, of Chandos Court, and I
don't know how many other places besides.  It
came upon us like a thunderbolt, for Chandos
never told us his uncle was a baronet, or that
he had any relatives but the merchant uncle.
He did tell me a few weeks ago that he had
just heard of the sudden death of his two
cousins, but he did not say any more, except
that he had not seen them above twice in his
life.  I suppose he may have thought it would
make no great difference to him, as his uncle
was not a very old man; but now his uncle has
just died too, and our Miss Chandos becomes
Sir Eustace.  Well, I only wish his uncle had
put off dying a little bit longer&mdash;just till I felt
more settled about things; but now I feel
sure I shall run away to sea if the mother
don't come round and give her consent.
</p>

<p>
May 12th.&mdash;Bravo!  Sir Eustace is not
going to leave us just yet.  It seems his
brother Frank is just coming back, and he
prefers to stay another year, and then he will
go to college, I suppose.  It don't seem to
have made a bit of difference in him either.
I thought perhaps he might like to drop our
friendship now he was so rich and I still poor
Charley Stewart, but he seemed hurt at the
bare suggestion, and so I am to call him
Chandos as usual, and we shall share the
room just the same as though nothing had
happened.  I have thought a good deal about
this the last two days.  I know a good many
fellows would have packed up their traps and
gone off at once, or else held their heads so
high that a poor chap like me would never be
able to speak to them; and I've been wondering
whether it's Chandos having learned so
many things about God that makes him different
in this.  I've thought, too, that perhaps
after all, as Chandos is just as willing to be
my friend now he is Sir Eustace, that God
may be my friend, as he said, though I can
hardly get used to the thought yet.
</p>

<p>
May 20th.&mdash;There has been a tremendous
row over the prize essay by which Tom won
the watch last Christmas.  After all this time,
when everybody thought it was
forgotten&mdash;though a good many of us did wonder then
how Tom managed it&mdash;now it is found out
that it was all made up of cribs, some taken
from books, and some from notes that one of
the older fellows lost.  Somebody must have
turned rat, Tom says.  He is in an awful rage
at having to give up the watch, but the
governor insisted; and now Tom is as dull
and looks as miserable as he can be, for the
school has sent him to Coventry over it, which
is very mean, I think, seeing they upheld him
last winter, when a good many at least knew he
had no right to try for this prize.  He must
wish he had let Chandos take his chance now,
I should think.  I cannot help pitying him,
and Chandos and I have agreed not to join
the school this time, though the other fellows
threaten us with Coventry for speaking to
Tom as we do.
</p>

<p>
The sea fever, as Chandos calls it, has
suddenly seized Tom again, and he is always
talking about it, as though we were both sure
of going.  I wish we were; but Tom's father
says he has no real liking for it, and therefore
won't let him go, and my mother is afraid.
Oh dear! if mother would only give her
consent! but she never will, I am afraid, and there
will be nothing for it but to run away.  Tom
says we had better make up our minds to go
from here before next Christmas.  If it wasn't
for the talks I've had with Chandos I'd do it;
but I think I must give the mother one more
chance, and see if I can't persuade her in the
holidays to let me go.  I wish I could think
of something to please her very much; I'd do
anything to get her consent to my going to sea.
</p>

<p>
June 4th.&mdash;I've been talking to Chandos.
He says I have got the sea fever very bad
this time, and he is afraid some of the other
boys will catch the infection.  I know what
he means.  He is afraid his brother may learn
to like the sea from hearing so much about it
from Tom, for the two are always together
now.  But I don't think he need to be afraid,
Frank would never do for the sea, I am sure.
He has persuaded me not to tease my mother
too much about these plans of mine these
holidays, but to go in for lots of grind next
half, and get a prize at Christmas, and then,
perhaps, when she sees I have really been
industrious with my lessons, and yet love the
sea as dearly as ever, she will be more likely
to yield.
</p>

<p>
The plan may be a good one&mdash;I think it is,
but it's precious hard.  Grind is not quite such
a trouble as it was at first, but still it's bad
enough; and what with no cribs, and the
extra I shall have to do if I am to have a
chance of taking a prize, it is just enough to
turn my brain.  I scratch my head and pull
a long face every time I think of it, but still I
think I will try it, hard as it is.
</p>

<p>
June 12th.&mdash;Mrs. Chandos has sent a very
pressing invitation for mamma and me to pay
them a visit at Chandos Court, and of course
Sir Eustace is quite eager that I should accept
it.  Not that he wants to show off his grandeur,
I could never believe that of Chandos.
</p>

<p><br /><br /><br /></p>

<p><a id="chap08"></a></p>

<h3>
CHAPTER VIII.
<br />
RUNNING AWAY TO SEA.
</h3>

<p>
August.&mdash;We are back at school once
more, and I am going to begin grinding
in real earnest for this prize.  The mater
has half consented, or at least half promised, to
give her consent if I get this prize.  Mrs. Chandos
talked her into this, I fancy, while we were
staying at the Court.  What a jolly time we
had there, in spite of its being awfully grand!
Everybody calls Chandos the "young baronet"
about there, and people touch their caps
to him as though he were a great swell, as I
suppose he is.  I never thought there was so
much fun in him as I know there is now.  He
seems to love fun as much as any of us, only
he is very careful that his pleasure does not
give any one else pain, which makes all the
difference in our way of getting fun; and I
fancy his enjoyment of it is deeper after all.
</p>

<p>
September 1st.&mdash;There is to be an extra
prize given for Latin this year, and the
examination is to take place early in December.
Chandos wants me to go in for this, but I am
half afraid.  It will want such lots of grind.
He says learning would not be so much
trouble to me if I would only make up my
mind to like it; but I don't think I shall ever
do this.  But still I must get one prize at
Christmas somehow; and having done my
lessons so long on the square, without even
touching a crib, I think I may manage it
without quite killing myself.
</p>

<p>
September 14th.&mdash;I wish prizes had never
been invented&mdash;never been thought of.  I
believe it's done just to plague boys.  Here
we are working like galley slaves; and if I
don't go on grind, grind, Chandos whispers,
"You forget the prize&mdash;you are going to sea."  No,
I don't forget it; I have been thinking of
it more than ever lately, and so has Tom.
He means to run away and get to Liverpool
before the winter sets in, and of course
he wants me to go with him, and calls me
"rat" and "coward" because I will not
promise.  Of course I don't mean to split on
him, for I can't help wishing I could go too;
but somehow, now that it seems possible I
may get my mother's consent to go in a
proper manner&mdash;go as a midshipman in the
Navy&mdash;I would rather wait, although I do
hate the grind.
</p>

<p>
Chandos says I shall have to grind harder
still if I go to the Naval College at
Greenwich; but I won't mind that so much, for
the grind will be about ships and navigation,
and not the stupid things we have to learn
here.
</p>

<p>
October 12th.&mdash;Tom means to go.  Everything
is so miserable here, he says.  The
fellows have been rather hard upon him, I
think, considering they all backed him up to
keep Chandos out of trying for the watch last
year.  Well, he don't want a watch now, but
he's going in for as much grind as though he
did, or as though he was still poor, and going
to mount his uncle's office stool, instead of
living in all the glory of Chandos Court.  But
I began about Tom.  He means to be missing
some fine morning, and to make his way
to Liverpool.  He thinks he shall be sure to
get a ship there, and is to write to me and his
father just before he sails.  He don't mean to
write to the governor at all, because he was
so mean about the watch.  We always talked
about selling that to pay our expenses on the
road, for of course Tom don't want to beg;
and to save him from this I have given him
all the pocket-money I had left, which was
only half-a-crown and twopence, for I never
can keep money long, now that old woman
with the bulls'-eyes comes to the playground
gate so often.  Poor Tom!  I wish I had more
I could give him, for things have been pretty
hard for him here lately, though I dare say he
deserved it for the mean trick he served
Chandos.  What a scare it will be when they
first find out that Tom has gone!  I shall
have to keep quiet, though&mdash;hear, see, and
say nothing, as they tell the youngsters, for I
cannot pretend to be anxious when I know
all about it, and I don't mean to split on Tom.
Sometimes I fancy that Chandos minor is in
the secret.  Tom is stupid if he lets too many
know what he is up to.  I should have kept
my own counsel, and not let Chandos know
this.
</p>

<p>
October 14th.&mdash;The house is all in
commotion.  Nothing has gone on in its proper
order, and everybody seems to be wondering
what will happen next.  Tom has gone&mdash;run
away to sea, as the boys are whispering to
each other; but that is not the worst.  I
knew he meant going when he said "Good
night" to me last night, and so I risked the
imposition I might get, and stayed in my
room this morning until Chandos came
rushing in, looking white and scared.
</p>

<p>
"Is Frank here, Stewart?" he said.
</p>

<p>
"Frank?&mdash;no, I haven't seen him," I said.
</p>

<p>
"Then he's gone&mdash;gone with Haslitt," he
said, dropping into a chair.  "Did you know
anything about this, Stewart?" he asked.
</p>

<p>
"I knew that Tom meant to go some time.
I've told you the same."
</p>

<p>
"But about Frank&mdash;what have you heard
about him?  Tell me instantly, Stewart.
Think of my poor mother."
</p>

<p>
"I don't believe your brother has gone
with Tom.  He isn't such a muff as to do
that."
</p>

<p>
"You forget the sea fever that we used to
tease him about in the holidays."
</p>

<p>
"Yes, I know we teased him, but nobody
could ever think Frank would be fit for sea.
Tom didn't, I know."
</p>

<p>
"But he's taken him&mdash;they're gone away
together, I'm certain."
</p>

<p>
"Oh, nonsense, Chandos.  Look here, now,
you mustn't split on Tom, or say a word to
the governor that I know anything about it;
but I've talked to Tom lots of times about
this, but he never said a word about anybody
else going with him.  He wanted me to go, of
course, but, failing me, he should have to go
alone, he said."
</p>

<p>
"But where can Frank be?  Nobody has
seen him this morning, and most of his clothes
and all his money have gone&mdash;I have been to
look."
</p>

<p>
"Well, if I thought&mdash;" and then I stopped.
"Look here, I can't split on Tom unless I am
quite sure that young muff has really gone.
Don't tell what I have said, Chandos; but if
they are together, Tom is the greatest stupid
I ever heard of, for he might be sure I should
tell all I knew then, and I will too.  Fancy
that poor little muff Frank handling tarred
ropes&mdash;he'd want to put his gloves on first!" and
I burst out laughing at the thought of
Chandos minor going to sea.  Chandos Court
would do for him nicely, but on board a ship
he would be in misery.
</p>

<p>
Chandos left me laughing, but soon came back.
</p>

<p>
"Stewart, you must go to the governor and
tell him all you know about this affair.  There
is no time to be lost, you see, for somebody
must go after them.  A carriage has been
ordered, and Swain is to go with a policeman;
but if they find out before starting which
road they have probably taken, perhaps it
may save hours, perhaps days, of delay."
</p>

<p>
"Well, I know Tom meant to go to Liverpool;
he told me so over and over again."
</p>

<p>
"Well, come and tell the Doctor before he
sends off the telegram to Haslitt's father."
</p>

<p>
"Is he going to send to your mother too?"
I asked.
</p>

<p>
"Not just yet.  I want to spare my mother
this anxiety if I can.  It was for this&mdash;to look
after Frank a little longer, because he is
inclined to get into mischief, that I decided
to stay here for the rest of the year, but it
seems I am of little use in preventing the
mischief.  But come now, Stewart, every
moment is precious."
</p>

<p>
So we tore off to the Doctor's study, where
he was closeted with a policeman.
</p>

<p>
"If you please, sir, Stewart has come to tell
you something about Haslitt," said Chandos,
pushing me forward.
</p>

<p>
"I don't know much, sir, only he said he
was going to Liverpool.  I shouldn't have
split about it only for little Chandos, and
he&mdash;"
</p>

<p>
"When did he tell you this, Stewart?  You
came to school together, I remember."
</p>

<p>
"Yes, sir, we are old chums, and he had
talked about going to Liverpool lots of
times."
</p>

<p>
"You meant to go together, then, young
gentleman?" said the policeman.
</p>

<p>
"Yes; I mean to go to sea, but I'll wait
till I get my mother's consent now.  Young
Chandos, though, isn't fit for the sea, and he
mustn't go."
</p>

<p>
"And you think they have taken the road
to Liverpool, young gentleman?"
</p>

<p>
"I am sure they have."
</p>

<p>
"And how do you think they meant to
travel?" asked the policeman again.
</p>

<p>
"Oh, they'd walk, unless Chandos junior
had lots of tin, and that ain't likely; for
Mother Brown makes us shell out for her
bulls'-eyes."
</p>

<p>
"Do you know how much money your
brother had, Chandos?" asked the governor.
</p>

<p>
"Not much, sir, I should think.  He came
to borrow some of me yesterday, but I only
gave him a shilling."
</p>

<p>
"Then we may conclude they are walking,"
said the policeman; and a few minutes
afterwards he and Swain drove away, and we
have been wondering ever since whether they
would catch the runaways."
</p>

<p>
October 20th.&mdash;Nobody heard anything
about Tom and Chandos until yesterday, for
they didn't go to Liverpool after all, and so
Swain and the policeman had their journey
for nothing.  Mr. Haslitt got here a few
hours after the telegram was sent, and asked
me all about Tom; but he was too impatient
to wait until Swain got back at night, as
everybody expected he would do, but went
off to London to set people to work at once,
in case they were not heard of.  It was just
as well he did, too, for Tom must have
changed his mind at the last minute, and
started for Plymouth instead of Liverpool,
for that was where he was found&mdash;he and
Chandos&mdash;wandering about the docks asking
everybody if they wanted a boy to go to sea.
Fancy anybody taking that poor little muff
Chandos!  And it seems Tom might have got
a berth for himself, but he wouldn't go without
Chandos, so they were both caught, and I'm
glad of it&mdash;glad at least that they found
Chandos minor, though I can't help feeling
sorry for Tom, for he'll have a harder time of
it than ever now, I fancy.
</p>

<br />
&quot;DO YOU WANT A BOY TO GO TO SEA?&quot;
</p>

<p>
His father is very angry with him, not only
for this last scrape, but about pretty well
everything that's happened since he's been
here; for of course it all came out in talking
to the governor and the boys, and that watch
affair he is mad about, and thinks it began all
the mischief.  But I think the beginning of it
was when he let Chandos into that scrape
about the farm-yard&mdash;that was the first mean
thing I ever knew Tom to do; and now if it
wasn't actual stealing it was next to it, for he
put Chandos minor up to taking his brother's
studs and a locket that was with them.  The
police found that out; I don't know what
those London fellows could not find out if
they tried.  Nobody had missed the things
until we heard they had been found, and then
Chandos went to the drawer where he had
put them and found they were gone, and
some money too; but he won't say a word
about the money, it seems.  He is dreadfully
upset, I know, although he is very quiet about
it; but I have come in rather suddenly once
or twice in the middle of the day, and found
him kneeling down, and though he has tried
to hide it, I know he was crying too.  He
need not be afraid of me now, though, for
I'd&mdash;well I'd rather kick up a row and laugh in
church than tell the other fellows of it.  I'm
in the secret a little.  I know he feels it
awfully about Frank, and I suppose it helps
him a bit to go and tell God all about it.
That's just what it is, I know.  He prays as
though God was as much his friend as I am
and just as ready to help him as I should be
if I could; and I know if I'd only got the
chance I'd do it.
</p>

<p>
October 24th.&mdash;Frank Chandos is back in
his place once more, but Tom has gone home
with his father.  I don't think anybody is
likely to try running away again in a hurry,
for to see Tom and Chandos minor when the
policeman brought them in was enough to
make anybody think twice before they tried
that game.  That poor little muff Chandos
cried like a girl, but Tom tried to brave it out
until he saw his father.  He gave it up then,
and I almost wished for his sake that we were
all on the alder pond again, for a more
miserable look I never saw on any face than that
on Tom's.  His head drooped, and he never
raised his eyes from the floor again while
we were there.
</p>

<p>
Poor old Tom! if he could only have been
brave enough to speak out the truth last year
about that farm-yard business, all the rest
might not have followed.
</p>

<p>
But this fuss about him and Chandos minor
has put everything else out of my head, and
I have forgotten all about the prize and the
grind too.  What a bother prizes are!  I'm
afraid I shall stand a poor chance of getting
this one now, for the other fellows who mean
to go in for it have been working like galley
slaves all the time this row was going on, but
I couldn't, and Chandos seemed to forget
everything but that little muff, and so I am
all behind, I know.
</p>

<p>
Chandos says I shall be able to make up
for lost time now if I only work steadily every
day, but there's the rub.  How can I be sure
that I can work steadily for more than a
month?  Fancy grinding without a lazy spell
for a whole month!  I'm sure I couldn't do
it, and so I may as well give up at once.  I
think I will, for what is the use of trying now?
It will be so much grind thrown away.  And
we are having such splendid weather now, that
won't last much longer, that it seems a pity
to be boring over a book a single minute
longer than I am obliged.  I shall tell Chandos
to-morrow that I mean to give up the whole
thing, for I can't do it.
</p>

<p>
November 1st.&mdash;I am grinding still, for
Chandos won't hear of my giving up.  He
says the things I learn&mdash;the grind&mdash;will be
more useful than the prize by-and-by; and
then he reminded me of my mother, and how
very pleased she would be if I gained this
prize.  I know that, and I should like to please
her for once, independent of the sea scheme.
This is the prize to me, for I don't care much
about the watch for itself; it will remind me
too much of poor Tom and his watch.  As
to the grind, what do I care about Julius
Cæsar and Hannibal and Rome and
Carthage?  If it was about Nelson and Howe,
and Abercrombie and Cook, and a few more
like them, I'd grind away, never fear.  Why
can't they let us know what the questions
are going to be&mdash;a few of them at
least? and then we might manage; but to be
expected to know all about everything, and the
fellows that lived hundreds of years ago, is
rather too stiff, and if it wasn't for Chandos I
should give it up, I know, much as I want to
please my mother.
</p>

<p>
November 7th.&mdash;I've had a letter from Tom.
Fancy Tom writing a letter!  He says everything
is just as miserable at home as it was
here, and he has to do no end of grind shut
up in his father's room.  He saw my mother
last week, and his father told her she need not
be afraid I should run away to sea now, for I
had learned a few things at school I was not
likely to forget in a hurry.  Well, that's true
enough; but I don't think Tom's father knows
what it is I have learned that prevented me
going with Tom, and I am not sure myself
that I have learned all the secret that makes
such a difference between Chandos and two
or three others and the rest of us at school,
that makes everybody take their word for
anything, and be sure they would not do a mean,
sneakish trick.  I feel as though I was
stopping just outside this secret, for God is not
my friend&mdash;at least I cannot feel that He is,
as Chandos does.  Sometimes I wish I could,
for I know this is more to him a great deal
than being Sir Eustace Chandos; but
somehow I don't seem able to get hold of it,
although I do believe it's true&mdash;all that
Chandos says about God being his friend.

<h3>
CHAPTER IX.
<br />
CONCLUSION.
</h3>

<p>
November 14th.&mdash;I'm in for it again.  It
isn't much this time&mdash;only a trick we
played off on Mother Brown.  The
mean old hunks! to say she never gave
credit, when she's cleaned us all out with her
nasty bulls'-eyes.  I'll never eat another, that
I won't.  The governor has heard of this
lark, and my share in it, I suppose, for I'm
ordered to go to his study at nine o'clock
to-morrow morning.  Well, I don't care what
the punishment is, so long as Mother Brown
don't hear of it; but she would glory in that,
I know, for I've led her a nice life lately.
</p>

<p>
November 17th.&mdash;I wish I could hang
Mother Brown, and choke her with her own
precious bulls'-eyes.  A nice imposition I've
had through her!  This fresh hindrance
would have taken away my last chance of
the prize; but now&mdash;well, I did not go
looking for the prize questions, but when they
were there right before my eyes, and nobody
else in the room, how could I help seeing
them?  I don't see that it's much of a cheat
either, for of course I shall answer them all
by myself, and if it helps me to know where
to read up&mdash;well, I've had a good many
hindrances, so that it's about fair after all.
</p>

<p>
November 20th.&mdash;I'm getting along
famously with my grind, I think, although
I almost wish I could forget those questions
sometimes.  But I can't, and without
meaning it I turn over the leaves of the book
that will answer some of them.  Yesterday
Chandos came and looked over my shoulder,
and when he saw where I was reading he
said, "Halloa, Stewart, I thought you said
you shouldn't look at that?"
</p>

<p>
"Did I?" I stammered, and I shut the book.
</p>

<p>
"Don't shut it up; I don't want to hinder
you.  I'm glad you're going in for it so
thoroughly," he said.
</p>

<p>
"Oh, don't bother!" I said, crossly; for
somehow I can't think of these questions and
Chandos at the same time, and I shall tell
him not to interfere if he comes poking round
again.
</p>

<p>
November 21st.&mdash;We have just heard that
our examination is to take place the second
of next month&mdash;about ten days hence.  I
wish it was over, or that I had never made
up my mind to go in for it.  I hate the very
name of prizes, and if I get it I'll shy the
watch down the first well I see.  What a fuss
Chandos is making too!  He says I am so
cross and touchy he cannot understand me.
I suppose not, for I cannot understand
myself just now.  I know one thing, though; I
hate Mother Brown and her bulls'-eyes, for if
it hadn't been for her I couldn't have seen
these questions, but now I have seen them I
can't forget them.  I've tried&mdash;I've turned to
another part of the book, and tried to read
and learn all about that, but although I began
to feel some interest in that before, I couldn't
now, and I was soon turning the leaves again.
I wish I had given it up when Tom went
away.  I'd do it now if it wasn't for Chandos,
but I should not like him to know anything
about this, and so I suppose I must go on.
I can do one thing, though; I can answer the
questions so badly that I shall lose the prize,
and that is how I must manage, though it's
rather hard after doing such lots of grind
for it.
</p>

<p>
November 25th.&mdash;I've just had a letter
from mamma.  I wish it had not come yet,
for it makes me wish to get this prize more
than ever.  I feel as though I must get it,
must have it now, and yet I have not touched
a book the last two days.  Chandos is puzzled
and concerned, I can see, and I hardly know
how to avoid him, and yet I try to do so all I
can.  Oh, why did the governor leave those
questions about?  It was dreadfully careless
of him.  If he had only locked them up in
his desk when he went to breakfast, as he
ought to have done, I couldn't have seen
them, and I shouldn't be in this trouble now.
I wonder whether Tom's prize essay worried
him as much!  If I could only get out of it
without letting anybody know of that sneaking
trick of peeping I'd do it; but how could
I tell them I was every bit as mean as Tom,
when I raved so about him last year?
Everybody would remember that, and throw it up
in my teeth, and they would say I had learned
it of Chandos too, and I couldn't bear that.
It's precious hard, but I shall have to go on.
I must and I will get this prize, if I can,
though I shall hate the sight of it, and hate
myself too.
</p>

<p>
December 3rd.&mdash;It's over.  I could answer
every question, of course; but&mdash;but, oh! how
I wish I had been ill, or something had
happened to prevent my going in for it at the
last minute.  I don't want this prize now, and
if I don't get it I shall be almost as thankful
as I was when Frank Chandos began to get
well.  I wish I could feel that God was my
friend, and would help me out of this scrape,
but I can't ask Him.  I've felt afraid
somehow to kneel down since I turned sneak
yes, I am a sneak, a mean, miserable sneak,
and I hate myself more than I hated Tom,
and I said hard things enough about him; but
I never thought then I should ever come to
do the same myself.
</p>

<p>
December 4th.&mdash;I had dropped my pen
and was actually crying yesterday, when
Chandos came in and caught me.
</p>

<p>
"What is the matter, Stewart?  Are you
ill, old fellow?" he asked, and he put his arm
round me, so that there was no getting away
from him.
</p>

<p>
"Don't, Chandos," I said, "I can't bear it!
I'm a miserable, mean sneak, and if you were
to kick me out of the room I should feel
better, for that's what I deserve.  Mind, I
never meant to be a sneak, and I didn't think
I ever should do such a mean trick, but now
you do know it you'd better turn me up as I
did Tom."
</p>

<p>
"Well, I don't know what you've done yet,
we'll talk about that afterwards; but just tell
me this, would you do the same thing again
if you had the chance?"
</p>

<p>
"Do it again?  I tell you I hate myself for
it; but the worst of it is, it won't undo it now
it's done.  I never thought I could be so
mean, Chandos."
</p>

<p>
"I suppose not; but bad as it is, you need
not give up all hope.  God knew how mean
you could be, and yet He will be your friend
if you would let Him.  Is it about the prize,
Stewart?"
</p>

<p>
"Oh yes; I do hope I shan't get it," I
groaned.
</p>

<p>
"Well, you shall tell me all about it
by-and-by if you like, but now just let me say
a word.  You never felt before that you were
a sinner&mdash;that you could do anything bad?"
</p>

<p>
"I've been trying to keep straight and do
everything on the square, but I may as well
give up now, for I see I can't do it."
</p>

<p>
"No, no, you won't give up, Charley.  I'm
going to call you Charley now, because I hope
we shall be better friends than ever after this.
I was just as miserable once as you are now.
I had told a lie, and I felt I could never be
forgiven; but my mother talked to me, and
I'll tell you as well as I can remember what
she said:
</p>

<p>
"'You've been very proud, my boy, and
thought you could get on very well without any
help but your own determination to do right.'"
</p>

<p>
"Well, what more do we want?" I said.
</p>

<p>
"Has it been enough, Stewart?  Hasn't
this been a miserable failure? and are you not
complaining now that you are more wicked
than you thought possible?"
</p>

<p>
"Well, yes, that's true enough," I confessed.
</p>

<p>
"Now let me tell you, Stewart, what
mother told me.  God knew you would fail.
He knew when He put Adam into the
garden of Eden that he wouldn't keep
straight long; but He gave him a fair chance,
and He loved him so much that He provided
a remedy at once for the sins he and all men
would commit.  The Lord Jesus Christ agreed
then to bear the sins of the whole
world&mdash;yours and mine among them, Stewart&mdash;and
this is what is meant by forgiveness of sins.
You never felt you needed forgiveness before
for you never felt the burden of sin."
</p>

<p>
"But look here, Chandos, I don't see how
God is going to forgive me, because, you see,
I knew better."
</p>

<p>
"Of course you did.  But have you never
read in your Bible, 'The blood of Jesus Christ
cleanseth us from all sin.'  'If we say that we
have no sin, we deceive ourselves, and the truth
is not in us'? but God is showing you the truth
now&mdash;that you need pardon and forgiveness,
and He is willing to give you these; pardon for
the sins already committed, to wash them all
away in the blood of His dear Son, who
gave His life for you; and not only pardon,
but grace and strength for the future to
enable you to resist the temptation to do
wrong at any future time."
</p>

<p>
"Look here, if God would help me like
that, I shall feel so glad," I said; "it's no
good for me to say I'll always keep on the
square any more after this mean trick, for
I may do another, as Tom did.  He didn't
stop at the first, and I'm afraid I shan't if
God don't help me.  Oh, Chandos, I do
want Him to help me out of this scrape,
and keep me from doing anything like this
again."
</p>

<p>
"Well, Charley, suppose we kneel down
now and ask God for this, and then you shall
tell me all about it if you like."
</p>

<p>
"I think I had better tell you first," I said,
"and then you can tell God for me.  I'll try
and do it myself by-and-by, but I can't just
at once.  I'm not good enough to kneel
down at all."
</p>

<p>
Then I told Chandos about the questions,
and we kneeled down together, and he asked
God to forgive me and help me to do what
was right.
</p>

<p>
"If God will only let me lose this prize
now I shan't care," I said, when we got up.
</p>

<p>
"But&mdash;but I don't think we ought to wait
for that," said Chandos.
</p>

<p>
"What can I do?" I said.
</p>

<p>
"Suppose you get it&mdash;and you may, you
know," said Chandos; "you would be obliged
to do something then."
</p>

<p>
"Oh, I can't bear to think of that.  Won't
God help me by giving it to another fellow?
</p>

<p>
"God will never help us to be cowards; He
will help you to do the brave and right thing,
which is to go to Dr. Mellor at once, tell him
all about it, and ask him to destroy your
papers."
</p>

<p>
"Tell the governor I'm a mean sneak!  I
couldn't do it, Chandos."
</p>

<p>
"Then God cannot help you in any other
way, nor I either.  I tell you He helps people
to be brave and do the right; but don't expect
He is going to screen you from the
consequences of sin, because He cannot and will
not; and to expect it would be like sawing
your finger with a sharp knife and not expecting
to cut it.  I will not attempt to persuade
you, Charley; but if you are sincere in asking
God's pardon now, and His help for the
future, you will not hesitate about this long."
</p>

<p>
"But it is so hard to do this, Chandos."
</p>

<p>
"Yes, and God knows exactly how hard it
is better than I do; but as soon as He sees you
are willing to bear this, and do the right,
He will give you the strength and courage
necessary."
</p>

<p>
When I lifted my head from my arms I
found that Chandos was gone.  I sat for
nearly an hour thinking over what he had
been saying&mdash;dear old Chandos! who is so
good himself, and yet not half so proud as I
was about poor Tom.  I wonder whether
God will help me as he says.  I don't deserve
it one bit, any more than I deserve that the
Lord Jesus should forgive me.
</p>

<p>
December 5th.&mdash;I am sure God has begun
to help me.  I went and made a clean breast
of it to the governor this morning, and he has
promised to burn my papers, and keep the
whole thing a secret from the rest.  It was
pretty hard to begin telling him, but when
once I had begun I did not feel a bit afraid,
and I must say he behaved splendidly.  He
didn't blow me up or order me an imposition
for prying round his table, but he said, quite
kindly,
</p>

<p>
"I am very sorry for you, Stewart.  I wish
you had come to me before, or told me you
had seen these questions, and I might have
saved you a great deal of unhappiness&mdash;for I
am sure you have been unhappy&mdash;and not
deprived you of all chance of getting the
prize.  Try and remember this for the future&mdash;I
am your friend as well as your schoolmaster,
and if there is any difficulty in which
I can help you I hope you will trust me as a
friend.  I am glad to see you and Chandos
get on so well together;" and then he actually
shook hands with me as I was going out of
the door.
</p>

<p>
I told Chandos all about it afterwards and
he said, "You know now how God helps
those who trust in Him; I hope you will never
forget it again."
</p>

<p>
I don't think I ever shall.  I don't feel
afraid to kneel down and ask His help now,
and I know I need it, for who can tell what I
might do next after this mean trick?
</p>

<p>
December 7th.&mdash;I have written and told
mamma how I have lost the prize.  I thought
I had better do this, for she had made so sure
I should get it if I really tried that I did not
like to go home without telling her first.  Poor
mamma!  I am sorry, for she is dreadfully
disappointed, I know, and I am afraid she
will not let me go to sea either.  I wonder
whether I shall be able to give up this wish
entirely, as Chandos did his?  I am afraid
not, for often in my dreams I seem to be on
the sea, and how can I ever forget it?  But I
must try to settle down, I suppose.  God will
help me in this, I know, as He did to go to
the governor, only it makes me feel dreadfully
old to think of it.
</p>

<p>
December 9th.&mdash;Everybody is busy packing
and getting ready to go home, but my packing
must wait until I write up my log once more.
I mean to tie it up and put it away until I go
to sea, for I am really going after all.  The
news came yesterday; my mother wrote to
say that, as I had had the moral courage to
confess having done wrong, half her fear about
my going to sea was taken away, for she felt
sure I was less likely to do wrong now I had
felt so much unhappiness about it than I was
before.  Dear mamma! she is mistaken here,
but I wonder whether I shall ever be able to
tell her that God alone can keep me from the
evil she fears?
</p>

<p>
I could not think much about this yesterday.
It was enough for me that I was going
to sea, and when I had read that much of the
letter, so as to understand it, I tore round the
playground, holding up the letter and shouting,
"Hurrah!  I'm going to sea&mdash;I'm going
to sea!"  Some of the fellows pretended to
think I was mad when I rushed at Chandos
and hugged him, and shouted, "It's all your
doing, old fellow.  I'm going to sea!  I'm
going to sea!"
</p>

<p>
"Let him alone; let him blow off steam,"
laughed Chandos when some of the fellows
tried to stop me, and I went round the
playground again like a steam-engine.
Everybody in the house knew it five minutes after
the letter came.  Luckily lessons were over
for the day, or there would have been an
imposition for me, but as it was nobody
interfered.

To-day I can think more about it, and
finish my log, for I shan't come here after
Christmas, and if I write another I shall get
a new book.  But I mean to keep this, for I
shall like to read it by-and-by; and if ever I
am likely to forget how God has been my
friend, and how I learned to know it, or if ever
I get into a scrape and am unhappy again, I
shall read what Chandos said to me a day or
two ago, that I may never forget: "The blood
of Jesus Christ cleanseth us from all sin."  We
only meant to laugh over it, Tom and I,
but now I think I shall remember some wise
and good words when I read up "Charley's
Log."
